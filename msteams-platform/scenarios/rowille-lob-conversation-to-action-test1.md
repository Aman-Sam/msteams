# Turn Conversation into Action

##### Category: Bots

##### Vertical/Industry: General/All

## Summary
This scenario demonstrates the ability to use Bots in Microsoft Teams to turn conversations into action...

## Use Case
The use case is to increase productivity by automating task execution… 

## User Story
UserA submits a time off request by sending a chat message to a bot that is able to automatically submit that request to the time management system in the proper format on behalf of the user. The Bot also automatically follows up with UserA’s time off request approved to verify the request is received and responded to. The Bot replies with a chat notifying UserA that the request was approved of denied. UserA never had to context switch to action this workflow, and the bot used natural language processing to properly execute the request.

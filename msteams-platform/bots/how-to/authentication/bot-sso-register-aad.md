# Enable SSO for your bot app in Azure AD

Azure AD provides app users access to your bot app. It's based on the app user's Teams identity. The app user who has signed into Teams can be given access to your bot app.

See the following video to learn about SSO in a bot app:
<br>
> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE4OASc]
<br>

## Configure SSO for your bot resource in Azure AD

The first step to enable SSO for your bot resource is to configure it in the Azure AD portal. The following details must be configured for enabling your SSO for your bot in Azure AD:

You can enable SSO for your Teams bot app in two ways:

- **Configure SSO using bot resource**:
  - Create bot resource and an app ID (You can also link it to the app ID of the already registered app).
  - Configure messaging endpoint and OAuth connection for the bot resource.
  - Configure access token, app ID URI, and trusted client IDs for the linked Azure AD app.
- **Configure SSO using Azure AD app**:
  - Register your app with Azure AD and configure access token, app ID URI, and trusted client IDs.
  - Configure bot resource using the app ID generated by Azure AD when you registered your app.
  - Create a bot resource and configure messaging endpoint and OAuth connection for it.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/register-bot-aad.png" alt-text="Register bot in Azure AD":::

By the end of this tutorial, you should have configured:

- Application ID
- Bot ID
- Access token
  - Application ID URI
  - Scope, permissions, and authorized client IDs
- Messaging endpoint and OAuth settings

> [!NOTE]
> This section assumes that you've created an app and a bot resource in Azure AD.
> - For more information about creating an app in Azure AD, see [To register a new app in Azure AD](../../../tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad.md#to-register-a-new-app-in-azure-ad).
> - For more information about creating and configuring your bot resource in Azure AD, see [Create Teams conversation bot](../../../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).

Select one of the following two ways to configure your bot resource for SSO in Azure AD.

# [Configure SSO using bot resource](#tab/botid)

<!--Before you enable SSO for your bot app, you must create and configure your bot resource in Azure AD. For more information, see [Create Teams conversation bot](../../../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).-->

To configure your bot resource for enabling SSO in Azure AD:

- **[Add messaging endpoint](#add-messaging-endpoint)**
  - **[Configure your app for SSO in Azure AD](#configure-your-app-in-azure-ad)**: You'll need to register your app with Azure AD before you configure it. Then, to enable it for SSO:
    - Configure scope for access token, application ID URI, and trusted client IDs
    - Configure access token version
- **[Configure OAuth connection](#configure-oauth-connection)**

### Add messaging endpoint

Messaging endpoint is where messages are sent to your bot. It enables communicate with your bot.

#### To configure messaging endpoint

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.
   The Microsoft Azure Bot page opens.

1. Enter the name of your Azure AD app in **Search** box, and open your app.

1. Select **Settings** > **Configurations**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/bot-app-menu.png" alt-text="bot-config-menu.png":::

1. Enter the URL where your bot app is available as the messaging endpoint.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/message-endpoint.png" alt-text="Define messaging endpoint where the bot interacts with the user." border="false":::

1. Select **Apply**.

    The messaging endpoint is created.

You've configured the messaging endpoint for your bot resource. Next, you must enable SSO for the Azure AD app.

### Enable SSO for Azure AD app

You need to configure permissions and scopes, authorize client applications, and update manifest for your Azure AD app. These configurations help invoke SSO for your bot app.

#### Configure scope for access token

Configure scope (permission) options for sending access token to Teams Client, and authorizing trusted client applications to enable SSO.

You need:

1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Apply**.

Congratulations! You've completed the following app configuration in Azure AD required to enable SSO for your bot app:

- Application ID
- Bot ID
- Access token
  - Application ID URI
  - Scope, permissions, and authorized client IDs
- Messaging endpoint and OAuth settings

# [Configure SSO using Azure AD app](#tab/windows)

To create and configure your app for enabling SSO in Azure AD:

- [**Configure your app in Azure AD**](#configure-your-app-in-azure-ad)
  - Configure scope for access token, application ID URI, and trusted client IDs
  - Configure access token version
- [**Configure bot resource in Azure AD**](#configure-bot-resource-in-azure-ad)
  - [To configure messaging endpoint](#to-configure-messaging-endpoint-1)
  - [To update OAuth connection](#to-update-oauth-connection-1)

## Configure your app in Azure AD

You can configure your bot app in Azure AD to configure the scope and permissions for access tokens.

You'll need to register your app in Azure AD and configure the tenancy and app's platform before you can configure it. Azure AD generates a new app ID that you must note. You'll need to update it later in the Teams app manifest file.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams Toolkit registers the Azure AD application in an SSO project. You can skip this section if you've used Teams Toolkit to create your app. However, you would need to configure permissions and scope, and trust client applications.

### Configure scope for access token

After you've registered your app, configure scope (permission) options. You need it for sending access token to Teams client and authorize trusted client applications.

To configure scope and authorize trusted client applications, you'll need:

- [To expose an API](#to-expose-an-api): Configure scope (permission) options for your app. You'll expose a web API, and configure the application ID URI.
- [To configure API scope](#to-configure-api-scope): Define scope for the API, and the users who can consent for a scope. You can let only admins provide consent for higher-privileged permissions.
- [To configure authorized client application](#to-configure-authorized-client-application): Create authorized client IDs for applications that you want to pre-authorize. It allows the app user to access the app scopes (permissions) you've configured, without requiring any further consent. Pre-authorize only those client applications you trust as your app users won't have the opportunity to decline consent.

Congratulations! You've completed the app configuration in Azure AD required to enable SSO for your bot app.

Next, you must configure a bot resource in Azure AD.

## Configure bot resource in Azure AD

To enable SSO for your bot resource:

- [To configure messaging endpoint](#to-configure-messaging-endpoint): Messaging endpoint is where messages are sent to your bot. It enables communication with your bot.
- [To update OAuth connection](#to-update-oauth-connection): For a bot to support SSO, you must update its OAuth connection settings. This process associates the bot with:

  - Azure AD application associated with the bot
  - The app's application ID URI
  - The permissions that the bot needs to obtain an access token

  With the Client ID and Client secret provided, the token store exchanges the token for a graph token with defined permissions.

You'll need to create a bot resource, create client secret, and enable it for Teams before enabling SSO. Note the client secret for your bot resource. You'll need to update it later to update OAuth connection.

Before you enable SSO for your bot app, you must create and configure your bot resource in Azure AD. For more information, see [Create Teams conversation bot](../../../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that when you create your bot resource, select the application ID of your the Azure AD app, which was generated when you [To register a new app in Azure AD](../../../tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad.md#to-register-a-new-app-in-azure-ad).

To enable SSO for the bot resource:
- Add messaging endpoint
- Update OAuth connection

### To configure messaging endpoint

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.
   The Microsoft Azure Bot page opens.

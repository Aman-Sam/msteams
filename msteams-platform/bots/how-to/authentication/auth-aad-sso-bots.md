# Single sign-on (SSO) support for bots

Single sign-on authentication in Azure Active Directory (AAD) minimizes the number of times users need to enter their sign-in credentials by silently refreshing the authentication token. If users agree to use your app, they need not provide consent again on another device and can sign in automatically. The flow is similar to that of [Microsoft Teams tab SSO support](../../../tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso.md), however, the difference is in the protocol for how a bot [requests tokens](#request-a-bot-token) and [receives responses](#receive-the-bot-token).

>[!NOTE]
> OAuth 2.0 is an open standard for authentication and authorization used by AAD and many other identity providers. A basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 is a prerequisite for working with authentication in Teams.

## Bot SSO at runtime

![Bot SSO at runtime diagram](../../../assets/images/bots/bots-sso-diagram.png)

Complete the following steps to get authentication and bot application tokens:

1. The bot sends a message with an OAuthCard that contains the `tokenExchangeResource` property. It tells Teams to obtain an authentication token for the bot application. The user receives messages at all the active user endpoints.

    > [!NOTE]
    >* A user can have more than one active endpoint at a time.
    >* The bot token is received from every active user endpoint.
    >* The app must be installed in personal scope for SSO support.

1. If the current user is using your bot application for the first time, a request prompt appears to request the user to do one of the following:
    * Provide consent, if required.
    * Handle step-up authentication, such as two-factor authentication.

1. Teams requests the bot application token from the AAD endpoint for the current user.

1. AAD sends the bot application token to the Teams application.

1. Teams sends the token to the bot as part of the value object returned by the invoke activity with the name **sign-in/tokenExchange**.
  
1. The parsed token in the bot application provides the required information, such as the user's email address.
  
## Develop an SSO Teams bot
  
Complete the following steps to develop an SSO Teams bot:

1. [Register your app through the AAD portal](#register-your-app-through-the-aad-portal).
1. [Update your Teams application manifest for your bot](#update-your-teams-application-manifest-for-your-bot).
1. [Add the code to request and receive a bot token](#add-the-code-to-request-and-receive-a-bot-token).

### Register your app through the AAD portal

The steps to register your app through the AAD portal are similar to the [tab SSO flow](../../../tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso.md). Complete the following steps to register your app:

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory – App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Select **New Registration**. The **Register an application** page appears.

    ![New registration](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step1.png)

3. In the **Register an application** page, enter the following values:
    1. Enter a **Name** for your app.
    2. Choose the **Supported account types**, select single tenant or multitenant account type.

        > [!NOTE]
        >
        > The users are not asked for consent and are granted access tokens right away, if the AAD app is registered in the same tenant where they are making an authentication request in Teams. However, the users must provide consent to the permissions, if the AAD app is registered in a different tenant.

    3. Choose **Register**.

    ![Register an application](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step2.png)

4. Go to overview page, copy, and save the **Application (client) ID** to update your app manifest later.

    ![Application Id](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step3.png)

5. Under **Manage**, select **API permissions**. 

    ![API Permissions](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step9.png)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
    > * If you are building a standalone bot, enter the Application ID URI as `api://botid-{YourBotId}`. Here **YourBotId** is your AAD application ID.
    > * If you are building an app with a bot and a tab, enter the Application ID URI as `api://fully-qualified-domain-name.com/botid-{YourBotId}`.

6. Select the permissions that your application needs for the AAD endpoint and, optionally, for Microsoft Graph.

7. [Grant permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent) for Teams desktop, web, and mobile applications.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**

    ![Expose an API](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step4.png)

1. Select **Add a scope**.

    ![Add a Scope](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step5.png)

1. In the panel that opens, add a client app by entering `access_as_user` as the **Scope name**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > The "access_as_user" scope used to add a client app is for "Administrators and users".
    >
    > You must be aware of the following important restrictions:
    >
    > * Only user-level Microsoft Graph API permissions, such as email, profile, offline_access, and OpenId are supported. If you need access to other Microsoft Graph scopes, such as `User.Read` or `Mail.Read`, see [Get an access token with Graph permissions](../../../tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso.md#get-an-access-token-with-graph-permissions).
    > * Your application's domain name must be same as the domain name that you have registered for your AAD application.
    > * Multiple domains per app are currently not supported.
    > * Applications that use the `azurewebsites.net` domain are not supported because it is common and may be a security risk.

1. In the **Who can consent?** box, enter **Admins and users**.
11. Enter the details in the boxes for configuring the admin and user consent prompts with values that are appropriate for the `access_as_user`scope.
    1. Admin consent display name: Teams can access the user’s profile.
    2. Admin consent description: Teams can call the app’s web APIs as the current user.
    3. User consent display name: Teams can access your profile and make requests on your behalf.
    4. User consent description: Teams can call this app’s APIs with the same rights as you have.

12. Ensure that the state is set to **Enabled**.

    ![State](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step6.png)

1. Go to **API Permissions**.

1. Select **Add a permission**. 

    ![API Permissions](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step9.png)

1. Select **Microsoft Graph**. 

    ![Microsoft Graph](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step10.png)

1. Select **Delegated permissions**. 

    ![Delegated Permissions](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step11.png)

1. Now, add the following permissions from Microsoft Graph API:
    * User.Read (enabled by default)
    * email
    * offline_access
    * OpenId
    * profile

    ![Openid permission](~/assets/images/authentication/SSOtabsauth/SSO-auth-step12.png)

1. Select **Update permission**.

#### Update the Azure portal with the OAuth connection

Complete the following steps to update the Azure portal with the OAuth connection:

3. In the Azure portal, go to [**AzureBot**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureBot)
4. Select **Configuration** on the left pane.
5. Select **Add OAuth Connection Settings**.

    ![SSOBotHandle2 view](~/assets\Contosoairlines123.png)

6. Perform the following steps to complete the **New Connection Setting** form:

    >[!NOTE]
    > **Implicit grant** may be required in the AAD application.

    1. Enter a **Name** in the **New Connection Setting** page. This is the name that is referred to inside the settings of your bot service code in *step 5* of [Bot SSO at runtime](#bot-sso-at-runtime).
    2. From the **Service Provider** drop-down, select **Azure Active Directory v2**.
    3. Enter the client credentials, such as **Client id** and **Client secret** for the AAD application.
    4. For the **Token Exchange URL**, use the scope value defined in [Update your Teams application manifest for your bot](#update-your-teams-application-manifest-for-your-bot). The Token Exchange URL indicates to the SDK that this AAD application is configured for SSO.
    5. In the **Tenant ID** box, enter *common*.
    6. Add all the **Scopes** configured when specifying permissions to downstream APIs for your AAD application. With the Client id and Client secret provided, the token store exchanges the token for a graph token with defined permissions.
    7. Select **Save**.

    ![VuSSOBotConnection setting view](../../../assets/images/bots/bots-vuSSOBotConnection-settings.png)

### Update your Teams application manifest for your bot

If the application contains a standalone bot, then use the following code to add new properties to the Teams application manifest:

```json
    "webApplicationInfo": 
        {
            "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "resource": "api://botid-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        }
```
If the application contains a bot and a tab, then use the following code to add new properties to the Teams application manifest:

```json
    "webApplicationInfo": 
        {
            "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "resource": "api://subdomain.example.com/botid-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        }
```

**webApplicationInfo** is the parent of the following elements:

* **id** - The client ID of the application. This is the application ID that you obtained as part of registering the application with AAD. Do not share this Application ID with multiple Teams apps. Create a new AAD app for each application manifest that uses `webApplicationInfo`.
* **resource** - The domain and subdomain of your application. This is the same URI, including the `api://` protocol that you registered when creating your `scope` in [Register your app through the AAD portal](#register-your-app-through-the-aad-portal). You must not include the `access_as_user` path in your resource. The domain part of this URI must match the domain and subdomains used in the URLs of your Teams application manifest.

### Add the code to request and receive a bot token

#### Request a bot token

The request to get the token is a normal POST message request using the existing message schema. It is included in the attachments of an OAuthCard. The schema for the OAuthCard class is defined in [Microsoft Bot Schema 4.0](/dotnet/api/microsoft.bot.schema.oauthcard?view=botbuilder-dotnet-stable&preserve-view=true) and it is similar to a sign-in card. Teams treats this request as a silent token acquisition if the `TokenExchangeResource` property is populated on the card. For the Teams channel, only the `Id` property, which uniquely identifies a token request, is honored.

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Bot Framework `OAuthPrompt` or the `MultiProviderAuthDialog` is supported for SSO authentication.

If the user is using the application for the first time and user consent is required, the following dialog box appears to continue with the consent experience:

![Consent dialog box](../../../assets/images/bots/bots-consent-dialogbox.png)

When the user selects **Continue**, the following events occur:

* If the bot defines a sign-in button, the sign in flow for bots is triggered similar to the sign in flow from an OAuth card button in a message stream. The developer must decide which permissions require user's consent. This approach is recommended if you require a token with permissions beyond `openId`. For example, if you want to exchange the token for graph resources.

* If the bot is not providing a sign-in button on the OAuth card, user consent is required for a minimal set of permissions. This token is useful for basic authentication and to get the user's email address.

##### C# token request without a sign-in button

```csharp
    var attachment = new Attachment
            {
                Content = new OAuthCard
                {
                    TokenExchangeResource = new TokenExchangeResource
                    {
                        Id = requestId
                    }
                },
                ContentType = OAuthCard.ContentType,
            };
            var activity = MessageFactory.Attachment(attachment);

            // NOTE: This activity needs to be sent in the 1:1 conversation between the bot and the user. 
            // If the bot supports group and channel scope, this code should be updated to send the request to the 1:1 chat. 

       await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(activity, cancellationToken);
```

#### Receive the bot token

The response with the token is sent through an invoke activity with the same schema as other invoke activities that the bots receive today. The only difference is the invoke name, **sign-in/tokenExchange** and the **value** field. The **value** field contains the **Id**, a string of the initial request to get the token and the **token** field, a string value including the token.

>[!NOTE]
> You might receive multiple responses for a given request if the user has multiple active endpoints. You must deduplicate the responses with the token.

##### C# code to handle the invoke activity

```csharp
    protected override async Task<InvokeResponse> OnInvokeActivityAsync
    (ITurnContext<IInvokeActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                try
                {
                    if (turnContext.Activity.Name == SignInConstants.TokenExchangeOperationName && turnContext.Activity.ChannelId == Channels.Msteams)
                    {
                        await OnTokenResponseEventAsync(turnContext, cancellationToken);
                        return new InvokeResponse() { Status = 200 };
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        return await base.OnInvokeActivityAsync(turnContext, cancellationToken);
                    }
                }
                catch (InvokeResponseException e)
                {
                    return e.CreateInvokeResponse();
                }
            }
```

The `turnContext.activity.value` is of type [TokenExchangeInvokeRequest](/dotnet/api/microsoft.bot.schema.tokenexchangeinvokerequest?view=botbuilder-dotnet-stable&preserve-view=true) and contains the token that can be further used by your bot. You must store the tokens for performance reasons and refresh them.

### Token exchange failure

In case of token exchange failure, use the following code:

```json
{​​ 
    "status": "<response code>", 
    "body": 
    {​​ 
        "id":"<unique Id>", 
        "connectionName": "<connection Name on the bot (from the OAuth card)>", 
        "failureDetail": "<failure reason if status code is not 200, null otherwise>" 
    }​​ 
}​​
```

To understand what the bot does when the token exchange fails to trigger a consent prompt, see the following steps:

>[!NOTE]
> No user action is required to be taken as the bot takes the actions when the token exchange fails.

1. The client starts a conversation with the bot triggering an OAuth scenario.
2. The bot sends back an OAuth card to the client.
3. The client intercepts the OAuth card before displaying it to the user and checks if it contains a `TokenExchangeResource` property.
4. If the property exists, the client sends a `TokenExchangeInvokeRequest` to the bot. The client must have an exchangeable token for the user, which must be an Azure AD v2 token and whose audience must be the same as `TokenExchangeResource.Uri` property. The client sends an invoke activity to the bot with the following code:

    ```json
    {
        "type": "Invoke",
        "name": "signin/tokenExchange",
        "value": 
        {
            "id": "<any unique Id>",
            "connectionName": "<connection Name on the skill bot (from the OAuth card)>",
            "token": "<exchangeable token>"
        }
    }
    ```

5. The bot processes the `TokenExchangeInvokeRequest` and returns a `TokenExchangeInvokeResponse` back to the client. The client must wait till it receives the `TokenExchangeInvokeResponse`.

    ```json
    {
        "status": "<response code>",
        "body": 
        {
            "id":"<unique Id>",
            "connectionName": "<connection Name on the skill bot (from the OAuth card)>",
            "failureDetail": "<failure reason if status code is not 200, null otherwise>"
        }
    }
    ```

6. If the `TokenExchangeInvokeResponse` has a `status` of `200`, then the client does not show the OAuth card. See the [normal flow image](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-sso?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#sso-components-interaction&preserve-view=true). For any other `status` or if the `TokenExchangeInvokeResponse` is not received, then the client shows the OAuth card to the user. See the [fallback flow image](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-sso?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#sso-components-interaction&preserve-view=true). This ensures that the SSO flow falls back to normal OAuthCard flow in case of any errors or unmet dependencies like user consent.


### Update the auth sample

Open [Teams auth sample](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/46.teams-auth) and then complete the following steps to update it:

1. Update the TeamsBot to handle the deduping of the incoming request by including the following code:

    ```csharp
        protected override async Task OnSignInInvokeAsync(ITurnContext<IInvokeActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                await Dialog.RunAsync(turnContext, ConversationState.CreateProperty<DialogState>(nameof(DialogState)), cancellationToken);
            }
        protected override async Task OnTokenResponseEventAsync(ITurnContext<IEventActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                await Dialog.RunAsync(turnContext, ConversationState.CreateProperty<DialogState>(nameof(DialogState)), cancellationToken);
            }
    ```
  
2. Update `appsettings.json` to include the `botId`, password, and the connection name defined in [Update the Azure portal with the OAuth connection](#update-the-azure-portal-with-the-oauth-connection).
3. Update the manifest and ensure that `token.botframework.com` is in the valid domains list. For more information, see [Teams auth sample](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/46.teams-auth).
4. Zip the manifest with the profile images and install it in Teams.

# Workflow bots in Teams

A workflow bot can be installed into a team, group chat, or as personal app, depending on different scopes. The default command logic simply returns a hard-coded Adaptive Card. You can customize this logic with your business logic. Often your business logic might require you to call your existing APIs. Users can create a workflow bot to respond to Adaptive card that are triggered by end users. Adaptive Card action handler provides one or more buttons in the card to ask for user's input by calling APIs that sends another Adaptive Card in conversation to respond to the respective card action.

> [!NOTE]
> You can choose the installation target when adding the app. For more install options see [Distribute your Teams app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-publish-overview).

## Card Action Handler

To simplify the development, the TeamsFx SDK provides an adaptive card action handler (`TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler`) to let you focus only on the development of business logic to respond to the card action without learning the Bot Framework SDK.

The following diagram illustrates how to respond to an Adaptive Card action with TeamsFx SDK:

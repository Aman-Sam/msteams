# Send proactive messages

[!INCLUDE [v4 to v3 pointer](~/includes/v4-to-v3-pointer-bots.md)]

A proactive message is any message sent by a bot that is not in direct response to a request from a user. This can include messages like:

* Welcome messages
* Notifications
* Scheduled messages

In order for your bot to send a proactive message, it must have access to the user, group chat, or team that you wish to send the message to. For a group chat or team, this means the app that contains your bot must first be installed to that location. You can [proactively install your app using Graph](#proactively-install-your-app-using-graph) in a team if necessary, or use an [app policy](/microsoftteams/teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings) to push apps out to teams and users in your tenant. For users, your app either needs to be installed for that user, or your user needs to be part of a team where your app is installed.

Sending a proactive message is different than sending a regular message in that you won't have an active `turnContext` to use for a reply. You may also need to create the conversation (for example a new one-to-one chat, or a new conversation thread in a channel) before sending the message. You cannot create a new group chat or a new channel in a team with proactive messaging.

At a high level the steps you'll need to complete to send a proactive message are:

1. [Get the user ID or team/channel ID](#get-the-user-id-or-teamchannel-id) (if needed).
1. [Create the conversation or conversation thread](#create-the-conversation) (if needed).
1. [Get the conversation ID](#get-the-conversation-id).
1. [Send the message](#send-the-message).

The code snippets in the [examples](#examples) section below are for creating a one-to-one conversation, see the [references](#references) section for links to complete working samples for both one-to-once conversations and group/channels.

## Get the user ID or team/channel ID

If you need to create a new conversation or conversation thread in a channel you'll first need the right ID to create the conversation. You can receive/retrieve this ID in multiple ways:

1. When your app is installed in any particular context, you'll receive a [`onMembersAdded` Activity](~/bots/how-to/conversations/subscribe-to-conversation-events.md).
1. When a new user is added to a context where your app is installed, you'll receive a [`onMembersAdded` Activity](~/bots/how-to/conversations/subscribe-to-conversation-events.md).
1. You can retrieve the [list of channels](~/bots/how-to/get-teams-context.md) in a team your app is installed.
1. You can retrieve the [list of members](~/bots/how-to/get-teams-context.md) of a team your app is installed.
1. Every Activity your bot receives will contain the necessary information.

Regardless of how you gain the information, you'll need to store the `tenantId` and either the `userId` or `channelId` in order to create a new conversation. You can also use the `teamId` to create a new conversation thread in the general/default channel of a team.

The `userId` is unique to your bot Id and a particular user, you cannot re-use them between bots. The `channelId` is global, however your bot _must_ be installed in the team before you can send a proactive message to a channel.

## Create the conversation

Once you have the user/channel information, you'll need to create the conversation if it doesn't already exist (or you don't know the `conversationId`). You should only create the conversation once; make sure you store the `conversationId` value or `conversationReference` object to use in the future.

## Get the conversation ID

Once the conversation has been created, you will use either the `conversationReference` object or the `conversationId` and the `tenantId` to send the message. You can get this Id by either creating the conversation, or storing it from any Activity sent to you from that context. Make certain that you store this Id.

## Send the message

Now that you have the right address information, you can send your message. If you're using the SDK, you'll do so using the `continueConversation` method,and the `conversationId` and `tenantId` to make a direct API call.  You'll need to set the `conversationParameters` correctly to successfully send your message - see the [examples](#examples) below or use one of the samples listed in the [references](#references) section.

## Best practices for proactive messaging

Sending proactive messages to users can be a very effective way to communicate with your users. However, from their perspective this message can appear completely unprompted and, in the case of welcome messages, it will be the first time they've interacted with your app. As such, it is very important to use this functionality sparingly (don't spam your users) and to provide enough information to let users understand why they are being messaged.

### Welcome messages

When using proactive messaging to send a welcome message to a user you must keep in mind that, for most people receiving the message, there will be no context for why they are receiving it. This is also the first time they will have interacted with your app; it is your opportunity to create a good first impression. The best welcome messages will include:

* **Why a user is receiving the message.** It should be very clear to the user why they are receiving the message. If your bot was installed in a channel and you sent a welcome message to all users, let them know what channel it was installed in and potentially who installed it.
* **What do you offer.** What can they do with your app? What value can you bring to them?
* **What should they do next.** Invite them to try out a command, or interact with your app in some way.

Remember, poor welcome messages can lead to users blocking your bot. You should spend plenty of time crafting your welcome messages, and iterate on them if they are not having the desired effect.

### Notification messages

When using proactive messaging to send notifications you need to make sure your users have a clear path to take common actions based on your notification and a clear understanding of why the notification occurred. Good notification messages will generally include:

* **What happened.** A clear indication of what happened to cause the notification.
* **What was the result.** It should be clear what item/thing was updated to cause the notification.
* **Who/what triggered it.** Who or what took action that caused the notification to be sent.
* **What can users do in response.** Make it easy for your users to take actions based on your notifications.
* **How can users opt out.** You need to provide a path for users to opt out of additional notifications.

## Proactively install your app using Graph

> [!Note]
> Proactively installing apps using the Microsoft Graph is currently in beta.

Occasionally it may be necessary to proactively message users that have not installed or interacted with your app previously. For example, you want to use the [company communicator](~/samples/app-templates.md#company-communicator) to send messages to your entire organization. For this scenario you can use the Graph API to proactively install your app for your users, then cache the necessary values from the `conversationUpdate` event your app will receive upon install.

You can only install apps that are in your organizational app catalogue, or the Teams app store.

See [Install apps for users](/graph/teams-proactive-messaging) in the Graph documentation and [Proactive bot installation and messaging in Teams with Microsoft Graph](../../../graph-api/proactive-bots-and-messages/graph-proactive-bots-and-messages.md). There is also a [Microsoft .NET framework sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/contoso-airlines-teams-sample/blob/283523d45f5ce416111dfc34b8e49728b5012739/project/Models/GraphService.cs#L176)  on the GitHub platform.

```csharp
private async Task MessageAllMembersAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)

    var teamsChannelId = turnContext.Activity.TeamsGetChannelId();
    var serviceUrl = turnContext.Activity.ServiceUrl;

    members.forEach(async (teamMember) => {
        const message = MessageFactory.text('Hello ${ teamMember.givenName } ${ teamMember.surname }. I\'m a Teams conversation bot.');

        var ref = TurnContext.getConversationReference(context.activity);
        ref.user = teamMember;

        await context.adapter.createConversation(ref,
            async (t1) => {
                const ref2 = TurnContext.getConversationReference(t1.activity);
                await t1.adapter.continueConversation(ref2, async (t2) => {

                });
            });
    });

    await context.sendActivity(MessageFactory.text('All messages have been sent.'));
}
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
async def _message_all_members(self, turn_context: TurnContext):
    team_members = await self._get_paged_members(turn_context)

    for member in team_members:
        conversation_reference = TurnContext.get_conversation_reference(
            turn_context.activity
        )

        conversation_parameters = ConversationParameters(
            is_group=False,
            bot=turn_context.activity.recipient,
            members=[member],
            tenant_id=turn_context.activity.conversation.tenant_id,
        )

        async def get_ref(tc1):
            conversation_reference_inner = TurnContext.get_conversation_reference(
                tc1.activity
            )
            return await tc1.adapter.continue_conversation(
                conversation_reference_inner, send_message, self._app_id
            )

        async def send_message(tc2: TurnContext):
            return await tc2.send_activity(
                f"Hello {member.name}. I'm a Teams conversation bot."
            )

        await turn_context.adapter.create_conversation(
            conversation_reference, get_ref, conversation_parameters
        )

    await turn_context.send_activity(
        MessageFactory.text("All messages have been sent")
    )

```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

```json
POST /v3/conversations
{
  "bot": {
    "id": "28:10j12ou0d812-2o1098-c1mjojzldxcj-1098028n ",
    "name": "The Bot"
  },
  "members": [
    {
      "id": "29:012d20j1cjo20211"
    }
  ],
  "channelData": {
    "tenant": {
      "id": "197231joe-1209j01821-012kdjoj"
    }
  }
}
```

You must supply the user ID and the tenant ID. If the call succeeds, the API returns with the following response object.

```json
{
  "id":"a:1qhNLqpUtmuI6U35gzjsJn7uRnCkW8NiZALHfN8AMxdbprS1uta2aT-jytfIlsZR3UZeg3TsIONNInBHsdjzj3PtfHuhkxxvS1jZZ61UAbw8fIdXcNSJyTJm7YvHFOgxo"
}
```

# Event-driven conversations with activity handlers

Events and handlers are two related concepts in a bot workflow. An event in bot workflow depicts an activity that triggers the bot to perform a certain action or task.

Activity handlers are functions or methods that contain the bot logic for how the bot handles different types of events. For example, in an event when a user reacts to the bot message, the bot has a handler for event, which defines what the bot must do or say in response to the userâ€™s action.

When an event occurs, activity handlers can identify the activity and forward it to the bot logic for processing. By incorporating an invoke activity into the handler logic, your bot can process the event and respond to the user based on the payload of the invoke activity.

`{Image is a place holder will share it for development as per design standards post SME approval}`

To create event-driven conversations, you must define the associated handlers that the bot will use with the event. You can also add [invoke activity](~/bots/how-to/conversations/bot-invoke-activity.md) to the handler logic. An invoke activity is a way of updating the bot to run another activity as part of the current conversation. This can help the bot to customize its logic and reuse existing activities for different events.

The following table lists information on which communication concept to use in different scenarios:

|Comunication flow| Use| Scenario |
|---|---| --- |
| User **->** Bot| [Activity handler](#events-with-activity-handlers) |Activity handlers are used when you want your bot to be notified when a user performs an event.|
| User **<->** Bot| [Activity handler](#events-with-activity-handlers) + [Invoke activities](~/bots/how-to/conversations/bot-invoke-activity.md)| Receive the event and share a response back to the user based on the event.|

## Events with activity handlers

Each activity type, or subtype, signifies a unique conversational event. The bots turn handler, which is responsible for managing the flow of conversation, triggers the specific activity handler based on the activity type. For example, when the bot receives a message activity, the turn handler identifies the activity and forwards it to the `onMessageActivity` handler. You can use the `onMessageActivity` handler to place your logic for managing and responding to messages.

```csharp
protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
  // Sends an activity to the sender of the incoming activity.
  await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Text($"Echo: {turnContext.Activity.Text}"), cancellationToken);
}
```

Teams activity handler is derived from [Bot Framework's activity handler](#bot-framework-activity-handler). The two primary Teams activity handlers are as follows:

* `OnConversationUpdateActivityAsync`: Routes all the conversation update activities.
* `OnInvokeActivityAsync`: Routes all Teams [invoke activities](~/bots/how-to/conversations/bot-invoke-activity.md).

## Conversation update events

You can use conversation update events to provide better notifications and effective bot actions. You can add new events any time and your bot begins to receive them. You must design your bot to receive unexpected events. If you are using the Bot Framework SDK without specifying any activity handlers in your bot code, your bot automatically responds with a `200 - OK` to any events you choose not to handle.

A bot receives a `conversationUpdate` event in any of the following cases:

* When bot is added to a conversation.
* Other members are added or removed in a conversation or channel.
* Conversation metadata is changed.

The following are different type of events associated with `conversationUpdate`:

| Events| Description| Scope |
|----| ------|----|
| [Installation events](#installation-events)| A bot is installed or uninstalled.| All |
| [Message events](~/bots/how-to/conversations/conversation-messages.md)| A message is sent, edited, deleted, restored, or reacted.| All |
| [Channel events](#channel-events)| A channel is created, renamed, deleted, or restored.| Team |
| [Members events](#member-events)| A member is added or removed.| All |
| [Team events](#team-events)| A team is renamed, deleted, archived, unarchived, or restored.| Team |

## Installation events

The bot receives an `installationUpdate` event when you install or unistall a bot in a conversation. On installing a bot, the `action` field in the event is set to `add`, and when the bot is uninstalled the `action` field is set to `remove`.

> [!NOTE]
> When you upgrade an application, the bot receives the `installationUpdate` event only to add or remove a bot from the manifest. For all other cases, the `installationUpdate` event isn't triggered. The **action** field is set to `add-upgrade` if you add a bot or `remove-upgrade` if you remove a bot.

The bot receives an `installationUpdate` event when the bot is installed. You can send an introductory message from your bot. This event helps you to meet your privacy and data retention requirements. You can also clean up and delete user or thread data when the bot is uninstalled.

Similar to the `conversationUpdate` event that's sent when bot is added to a team, the conversation.ID of the `installationUpdate` event is set to the ID of the channel selected by a user during app installation or the channel where the installation is occurred and must be used by the bot when sending a welcome message. For scenarios where the ID of the default channel is explicitly required, you can get it from `team.id` in `channelData`.

In the following example, the `conversation.id` of the `conversationUpdate` and `installationUpdate` activities will be set to the ID of the Response channel in the Daves Demo team.

![Create a selected channel](~/assets/videos/addteam.gif)

> [!NOTE]
> The selected channel ID is only set on `installationUpdate.add` events that are sent when an app is installed into a team.

You can also use a dedicated handler for `add` or `remove` scenarios as an alternative method to capture an event.

```csharp
     protected override async Task OnInstallationUpdateAddAsync(ITurnContext<IInstallationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
     {

### Uninstall behavior for personal app with bot

When you uninstall an app, the bot is also uninstalled. When a user sends a message to your app after the bot is uninstalled, they receive a `403` response code. The post uninstall behavior for bots in the personal, Team, and groupChat scopes are now aligned. You can't send or receive messages after an app has been uninstalled.

:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/bots/uninstallbot.png" alt-text="Uninstall response code"lightbox="~/assets/images/bots/uninstallbot.png":::

### Event handling for install and uninstall events

When you use these install and uninstall events, there are some instances where bots give exceptions on receiving unexpected events from Teams, which occurs in the following cases:

* You build your bot without the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK, and as a result the bot gives an exception on receiving an unexpected event.

* You build your bot with the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK, and you select to alter the default event behavior by overriding the base event handle.

  It's important to know that new events can be added anytime in the future and your bot begins to receive them. So you must design for the possibility of receiving unexpected events.

## Channel events

Channel events are triggered for the following events:

* Channel created
* Channel renamed
* Channel deleted
* Channel restored

**Channel created**: The `channelCreated` event is sent to your bot whenever a new channel is created in a team where your bot is installed in the `Team` scope.

## Member events

Member events are triggered for the following events:

* Members added
* Members removed

**Members added**: The `membersAdded` event is sent to your bot whenever a new user or bot is added to a conversation.

A member added event is sent to your bot in the following scenarios:

* When the bot is installed and added to a conversation.
* When a user is added to a conversation where the bot is installed.

The `membersAdded` event activity type is set to `teamMemberAdded` when the event is sent from a team context. To determine if the new member added is a bot or a user, check the `Activity` object of the `turnContext` for `MembersAdded`. If the `MembersAdded` list contains an object where `id` is the same as the `Recipient.id`, then the member added is the bot, else it's a user. The bot `id` is formatted as `28:<MicrosoftAppId>`.

**Members removed**: The `membersRemoved` event is sent to your bot whenever a user or bot is removed from a conversation.

A member removed event is sent to your bot in the following scenarios:

1. When the bot, itself, is uninstalled and removed from a conversation.
1. When a user is removed from a conversation where the bot is installed.

The `MembersRemoved` event activity type is set to `teamMemberRemoved` when the event is sent from a team context. To determine if the new member removed is the bot or a user, check the `Activity` object of the `turnContext` for `MembersRemoved`. If the `MembersRemoved` list contains an object where `id` is the same as the `Recipient.id` then the member added is the bot, else it's a user. The bot ID is formatted as `28:<MicrosoftAppId>`.

> [!NOTE]
> When a user is permanently deleted from a tenant, `membersRemoved conversationUpdate` event is triggered.

You can also use the [`InstallationUpdate`](#installation-events) event to determine when your bot is added or removed from a conversation.

## Team events

Team events are triggered for the following events:

* Team renamed
* Team deleted
* Team archived
* Team unarchived
* Team restored

**Team renamed**: The bot is notified when the team is renamed. It receives a `conversationUpdate` event with `eventType.teamRenamed` in the `channelData` object in the `Team` scope.

## Handling errors in events

When a bot encounters an error while handling different events or activities, don't send messages that have no meaningful context to the conversation as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/handling-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you the error message response in bot conversation.":::

In the development phase, it's always helpful to send meaningful messages in conversations, which provide additional details about a specific error for better debugging. However, in the production environment, you must log the errors or events to Azure Application Insights. For more information, see [add telemetry to your bot](https://aka.ms/bottelemetry).

### Bot Framework activity handler

Bots derived from the Teams activity handler class, first checks for Teams activities. After checking for Teams activities, it passes all other activities to the Bot Framework's activity handler.

# [C#](#tab/csharp15)

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Except for the **added** and **removed** members' activities, all the activity handlers described in this section continue to work as they do with a non-Teams bot.
>* `onInstallationUpdateActivityAsync()` method is used to get Teams Locale while adding the bot to Teams.

Activity handlers are different in context of a team, where a new member is added to the team instead of a message thread.

The list of handlers defined in `ActivityHandler` includes the following events:

| Event | Handler | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Any activity type received | `OnTurnAsync` | This method calls one of the other handlers, based on the type of activity received. |
| Message activity received | `OnMessageActivityAsync` | You can override this method to handle a `Message` activity. |
| Message update activity received | `OnMessageUpdateActivityAsync` | You can override this method to handle a message update activity. |
| Message delete activity received | `OnMessageDeleteActivityAsync` | You can override this method to handle a message delete activity. |
| Conversation update activity received | `OnConversationUpdateActivityAsync` | This method calls a handler if members other than the bot joined or left the conversation, on a `ConversationUpdate` activity. |
| Non-bot members joined the conversation | `OnMembersAddedAsync` | This method can be overridden to handle members joining a conversation. |
| Non-bot members left the conversation | `OnMembersRemovedAsync` | This method can be overridden to handle members leaving a conversation. |
| Event activity received | `OnEventActivityAsync` | This method calls a handler specific to the event type, on an `Event` activity. |
| Token-response event activity received | `OnTokenResponseEventAsync` | This method can be overridden to handle token response events. |
| Non-token-response event activity received | `OnEventAsync` | This method can be overridden to handle other types of events. |
| Other activity type received | `OnUnrecognizedActivityTypeAsync` | This method can be overridden to handle any activity type otherwise unhandled. |

The list of handlers defined in `ActivityHandler` includes the following events:

| Event | Handler | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Any activity type received | `onTurn` | This method calls one of the other handlers, based on the type of activity received. |
| Message activity received | `onMessage` | This method helps to handle a `Message` activity. |
| Message update activity received  | `onMessageUpdate` | This method calls a handler if a message is updated. |
| Message delete activity received | `onMessageDelete` | This method calls a handler if a message is deleted. |
| Conversation update activity received | `onConversationUpdate` | This method calls a handler if members other than the bot joined or left the conversation, on a `ConversationUpdate` activity. |
| Non-bot members joined the conversation | `onMembersAdded` | This method helps to handle members joining a conversation. |
| Non-bot members left the conversation | `onMembersRemoved` | This method helps to handle members leaving a conversation. |
| Event activity received | `onEvent` | This method calls a handler specific to the event type, on an `Event` activity. |
| Token-response event activity received | `onTokenResponseEvent` | This method helps to handle token response events. |
| Other activity type received | `onUnrecognizedActivityType` | This method helps to handle any activity type otherwise unhandled. |
| message edit | `onTeamsMessageEditEvent` | You can override this method to handle when a message in a conversation is edited. |
| message undelete | `onTeamsMessageUndeleteEvent` | You can override this method to handle when a deleted message in a conversation is undeleted. For example, when the user decides to undo a deleted message. |
| message soft delete | `onTeamsMessageSoftDeleteEvent` | You can override this method to handle when a message in a conversation is soft deleted. |

    protected override async Task OnMembersAddedAsync(IList<ChannelAccount> membersAdded, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var welcomeText = "Hello and welcome!";
        foreach (var member in membersAdded)
        {
            if (member.Id != turnContext.Activity.Recipient.Id)
            {
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Text(welcomeText, welcomeText), cancellationToken);

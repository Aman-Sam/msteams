# Requirements and considerations for application-hosted media bots

An application-hosted media bot requires the [`Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls.Media` .NET library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls.Media/) to access the audio and video media streams. You must deploy the bot on a Windows Server on-premises machine or a Windows Server guest Operating System (OS) in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * The guidance for developing messaging and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) bots doesn't completely apply to building application-hosted media bots.
> * As the Microsoft Real-time Media Platform for bots is in developer preview, the guidance in this document is subject to change.

## C# or .NET and Windows Server for development

An application-hosted media bot has the following requirements:

* You must develop the bot in C# and the standard .NET Framework and deploy the bot in Microsoft Azure. You can't use C++ or Node.js APIs to access real-time media and .NET Core isn't supported for an application-hosted media bot.

* You can host the bot in one of the following Azure service environments:
  * Cloud Service
  * Service Fabric with Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets
  * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Virtual Machine (VM)  
  
* You can't deploy the bot as an Azure web app.

* The bot must run on a recent version of the `Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls.Media` .NET library. The bot must use either the latest available version of the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls.Media/), or a version that isn't more than three months old. Older versions of the library are deprecated and don't work after a few months. Keeping the `Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls.Media` library up-to-date ensures the best interoperability between the bot and Microsoft Teams.

## Real-time media calls stay where they're created

Real-time media calls stay on the device where they're created. A real-time media call is pinned to the virtual machine (VM) instance that accepted or started the call. Media from a Teams call or meeting flows to that VM instance, and media the bot sends back to Teams must also originate from that VM. If there are any real-time media calls in progress when the VM is stopped, those calls are abruptly terminated. If the bot has prior knowledge of the pending VM shutdown, it can end the calls.

## Application-hosted media bots accessible on the internet

Application-hosted media bots must be directly accessible on the internet. These bots must include the following features:

* Each VM instance hosting an application-hosted media bot in Azure must be directly accessible from the internet using an instance-level public IP address (ILPIP).
  * For obtaining and configuring an ILPIP for an Azure Cloud Service, see [instance level public IP classic overview](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-instance-level-public-ip).
  * For configuring an ILPIP for a Virtual Machine Scale Set, see [public IPv4 per virtual machine](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-networking#public-ipv4-per-virtual-machine).

* The service hosting an application-hosted media bot must also configure each VM instance with a public-facing port, which maps to the specific instance.
  * For an Azure Cloud Service, the configuration requires an instance input endpoint. For more information, see [enable communication for role instances in Azure](/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-enable-communication-role-instances).
  * For a Virtual Machine Scale Set, you need to configure a NAT rule on the load balancer. For more information, see [virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/network-overview).

* The Bot Framework Emulator doesn't support application-hosted media bots.

## Scalability and performance considerations

The application-hosted media bots require the following scalability and performance considerations:

* Application-hosted media bots require more computing and network (bandwidth) capacity than messaging bots and may incur higher operational costs. A real-time media bot developer must carefully measure the bot's scalability, and ensure the bot doesn't accept more simultaneous calls than it can manage. A video-enabled bot may be able to sustain only one or two concurrent media sessions per CPU core (if using the "raw" RGB24 or NV12 video formats).
* The Real-time Media Platform doesn't currently take advantage of any Graphics Processing Units (GPU) available on the VM to off-load H.264 video encoding and decoding. Instead, the platform encodes and decodes video in software on the CPU. If a GPU is available, the bot may take advantage of it for its own graphics rendering, for example, if the bot is using a 3D graphics engine.
* The VM instance hosting the real-time media bot must have at least two CPU cores. For Azure, we recommend a Dv2-series virtual machine. For other Azure VM types, a system with four virtual CPUs (vCPU) is the minimum size required. Detailed information about Azure VM types is available in the [Azure documentation](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general).

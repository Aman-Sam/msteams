# Create Incoming Webhooks

An Incoming Webhook lets external applications to share content in Microsoft Teams channels. The webhooks are used as tools to track and notify. The webhooks provide a unique URL, to send a JSON payload with a message in card format. Cards are user interface containers that include content and actions related to a single article. You can use cards in the following capabilities:

* Bots
* Message extensions
* Connectors

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can choose to build notification bot Teams app other than Incoming Webhooks. They perform similarly but notification bot has more functionalities. For more information, see [Build notification bot with JavaScript](../../sbs-gs-notificationbot.yml) or [Incoming Webhook notification sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx-Samples/tree/dev/incoming-webhook-notification). To get started, download [Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) now and explore. For more information, see [Teams Toolkit documents](../../toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals.md).

## Key features of an Incoming Webhook

The following table provides the features and description of an Incoming Webhook:

| Features | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
|Adaptive Cards using an Incoming Webhook | Adaptive Cards can be sent through Incoming Webhooks. For more information, see [Send Adaptive Cards using Incoming Webhooks](../../webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using.md#send-adaptive-cards-using-an-incoming-webhook).|
|Actionable messaging support|Actionable message cards are supported in all Office 365 groups including Teams. If you send messages through cards, you must use the actionable message card format. For more information, see [legacy actionable message card reference](/outlook/actionable-messages/message-card-reference) and [message card playground](https://messagecardplayground.azurewebsites.net).|
|Independent HTTPS messaging support|Cards provide information clearly and consistently. Any tool or framework that can send HTTPS POST requests can send messages to Teams through an Incoming Webhook.|
|Markdown support|All text fields in actionable messaging cards support basic Markdown. Don't use HTML markup in your cards. HTML is ignored and treated as plain text.|
|Scoped configuration|Incoming Webhook is scoped and configured at the channel level.|
|Secure resource definitions|Messages are formatted as JSON payloads. This declarative messaging structure prevents the insertion of malicious code.|

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Teams bots, message extensions, Incoming Webhook, and the Bot Framework support Adaptive Cards. Adaptive Cards is an open cross card platform framework that is used in all platforms such as Windows, Android, iOS, and so on. Currently, [Teams connectors](../../webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-creating.md) don't support Adaptive Cards. However, it is possible to create a [flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-flow-in-microsoft-teams/) that posts Adaptive Cards to a Teams channel.
> * For more information on cards and webhooks, see [Adaptive cards and Incoming Webhooks](~/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-cards.md#adaptive-cards-and-incoming-webhooks).

# Create workflows

Workflows let you automate repetitive tasks or processes that connect one or more apps to Teams. In short, they can save you time and effort.

The easiest way to get started is to browse our selection of pre-built workflows.

1. Select Apps icon :::image type="icon" source="../../assets/images/workflows/app icon.png" border="false"::: from the left of Teams.

1. Scroll and select Workflow logo Workflows from the navigation on the left.

1. Select a workflow that interests you.

1. Follow the prompts to Sign in.
1. When done, you’ll get a confirmation saying, "Workflow added successfully!" The confirmation also includes instructions for running your workflow.
1. Select **Add**.

## Select the channel

1. On the left side of Teams, select the Teams icon to view your teams and channels.
1. Select the channel you want to add the workflow to by right-clicking on the channel, or by clicking **More options**.
1. Select **Workflows**.
1. In the Workflows dialog box, select the workflow you want to add to the channel.

* Common workflows are grouped by type.  
* If you don’t see the workflow you need, you can search in the Find workflows search box.  
* If you select More workflows, the Workflows app will open. From here, you can browse all workflow templates, or create a new one.
* If you select Manage workflows, the Workflows app will open. From here, you can manage existing workflows, browse all workflow templates, or create a new one.

## Configure the workflow

1. Select a descriptive name for the workflow or use the suggested name.
1. Ensure that you are signed in to the apps needed for the selected workflow. Select Next.
1. Fill in the Details for the workflow. Detail items might include things like email addresses, Planner groups, SharePoint libraries and more.
1. Select the Teams team and the Teams channel where you would like the workflow to run.
1. Select Add workflow to add the workflow to the channel.

Remember, after creating your workflow, you can manage it from the Workflows app in Teams or in Power Automate. Also, be aware that the workflows you create within the Workflows app in Microsoft Teams are always created in your organization's default environment.

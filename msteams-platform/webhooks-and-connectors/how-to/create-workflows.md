# Create workflows

Workflows are designed to streamline your routine tasks and processes by integrating various apps with Teams. Workflows allow users let you automate repetitive tasks or processes to save time and effort spent following up on repetitive tasks. The article shows you the steps to incorporate, execute, and oversee your workflows.

If you're facing one or more of the following scenarios, then workflows opportunities to automate:

* Repetitive tasks within Teams.
* Alternating between Teams and other apps for updates or tasks.
* Transferring information from Teams to other applications.
* Preferring Teams notifications over email alerts.
* Regularly asking the same questions in Teams communications.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using connectors to automate repetitive tasks, we are transitioning to Workflow for more efficient automation.

You can create a workflow in the channel and chat scopes. Once you create the workflow, you can add or run a workflow from messaging area or from the message.

    If you're adding Workflows for the first time, the Workflows app is first added.

1. Follow the prompts to Sign in.
1. When done, you’ll get a confirmation saying, "Workflow added successfully!" The confirmation also includes instructions for running your workflow.
1. Select **Add**.

Workflows that you added here are shown in the channel or chat, when you want to add a Workflow in that scope.

## Select the channel

1. On the left side of Teams, select the Teams icon to view your teams and channels.
1. Select the channel you want to add the workflow to by right-clicking on the channel, or by clicking **More options**.
1. Select **Workflows**.
1. In the Workflows dialog box, select the workflow you want to add to the channel.

* Common workflows are grouped by type.  
* If you don’t see the workflow you need, you can search in the Find workflows search box.  
* If you select More workflows, the Workflows app will open. From here, you can browse all workflow templates, or create a new one.
* If you select Manage workflows, the Workflows app will open. From here, you can manage existing workflows, browse all workflow templates, or create a new one.

## Configure the workflow

1. Select a descriptive name for the workflow or use the suggested name.
1. Ensure that you are signed in to the apps needed for the selected workflow. Select Next.
1. Fill in the Details for the workflow. Detail items might include things like email addresses, Planner groups, SharePoint libraries and more.
1. Select the Teams team and the Teams channel where you would like the workflow to run.
1. Select Add workflow to add the workflow to the channel.

Remember, after creating your workflow, you can manage it from the Workflows app in Teams or in Power Automate. Also, be aware that the workflows you create within the Workflows app in Microsoft Teams are always created in your organization's default environment.

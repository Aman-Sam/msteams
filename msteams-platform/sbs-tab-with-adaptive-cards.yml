    You can build Adaptive Card tabs in Teams. Instead of embedding web content in an iFrame, you can render Adaptive Cards to a tab. While the front end is rendered with Adaptive Cards, the backend is powered by a bot. The bot is responsible for accepting requests and responding appropriately with the Adaptive Card that is rendered.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Adaptive Card tabs will be deprecated in the new Microsoft Teams. Apps are expected to be available in the new Microsoft Teams by June 2023. If your app is using Adaptive Card tabs, it's recommended to rebuild the tab as a web-based tab. For more information, see [Build tabs for Teams](tabs/what-are-tabs.md).

    You can build your tabs with relevant user interface (UI) building blocks, which are native to desktop, web, and mobile.

    This article helps you to understand:
    
    * Changes required to be made to the app manifest.
    * Identifies how the invoke activity requests and sends information in tab with the Adaptive Cards.
    * Effects on the dialog (referred as task module in TeamsJS v1.x) workflow.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to build tabs with the Adaptive Cards on desktop and mobile. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

     &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call-all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. Use the latest version or install the portable version. |
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> Or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm devDependencies). |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    Register your bot with Azure Bot service when you develop and host it in Azure. Perform the following steps:

    1. Create a ngrok tunnel to your web server's endpoints.
    1. Create Azure Bot resource to register bot with Azure Bot service.
    1. Create client secret that enables single sign-on (SSO) authentication of the bot.
    1. Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    1. Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    To ensure that the bot service enables users to sign in and access the bot, you must configure SSO for your bot. Perform the following steps to configure:
    
    1. Add Redirect URI to the Azure Bot resource.
    1. Add any necessary API permissions for downstream calls.
    1. Enable implicit grant and hybrid flows.
    1. Update manifest.
    1. Set up bot service connection.

    The most comprehensive way to test your bot is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is to test the full functionality available to your bot across all scopes. You can configure and run the Teams app by uploading the `manifest.zip` file.

    **To configure manifest file**
    
    1. Go to the **manifest.json** file in the cloned repository.      
    1. Open the **manifest.json** file and update the following changes:

    1. Replace all occurrences of `{contentBotId}` and `{Microsoft App ID}` with your bot's Microsoft App ID.

    **Add file upload bot in Teams**

    1. In your cloned repository, Go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples** > **samples** > **tab-adaptive-cards** > **csharp** > **TabWithAdpativeCardFlow** > **AppPackage**.

    1. Create a .zip file with the following files that are present in the **AppPackage** folder:
       * manifest.json
       * outline.png
       * color.png 

       :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/adaptive-cards/zip.png" alt-text="zip file":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > The `manifest.zip` must not contain any additional folders in it. It must have **manifest** json source file, **color** icon, and **outline** icon inside the zip folder.

    1. In the Teams client, select the **Apps** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Upload an app**
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, custom app upload is enabled.

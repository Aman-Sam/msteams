    Adaptive Card tabs are a new way to build tabs in Teams. Instead of embedding web content in an IFrame, you can render Adaptive Cards to a tab. While the front end is rendered with Adaptive Cards, the backend is powered by a bot. The bot is responsible for accepting requests and responding appropriately with the Adaptive Card that is rendered.

    You can build your tabs with relevant user interface (UI) building blocks native on desktop, web, and mobile.

    This article helps you understand:
    
    * The changes required to be made to the app manifest.
    * Identifies how the invoke activity requests and sends information in tab with Adaptive Cards.
    * Effect on the task module workflow.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to build tabs with Adaptive Cards on desktop and mobile. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

    * Microsoft Teams with an account (not a guest account)
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    * [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 3.1
    * [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Tunnel Relay](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-tunnelrelay)
    * [Microsoft 365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.

- title: Create a Bot Registration in Microsoft Azure portal
  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |
    Adaptive Card tabs would require Azure Bot Service to build tabs in teams. Register bot with Azure Bot Service when you develop and host it in Azure. Perform the following:
    1. Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your web server's endpoints.
    1. Create Azure Bot resource to register bot with Azure Bot Service.
    1. Create client secret that enables SSO authentication of the bot.
    1. Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    1. Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

    **To create Azure Bot resource**

    1. Open [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    1. Select **Create a resource**.
    1. Search for **Azure bot** in the search box.
    1. Select **Azure Bot**.

        :::image type="content" source="/assets/images/azure-bot.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the azure bot.":::

    1. Select **Create**.
    1. Enter bot handle name in **Bot handle** field.
    1. Select your **Subscription** from the dropdown list.
    1. Select your **Resource group** from the dropdown list.
        
        To create a new resource group, select **Create new**, enter resource name, select **OK**, and select required location from **New resource group location** dropdown list.

    1. Select **Type of App** as **Multi Tenant** for **Microsoft App ID**.

    The most comprehensive way to test your bot is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is the only way to test the full functionality available to your bot, across all scopes. You can configure and run the Teams app by uploading the `manifest.zip` file.

    **To run the Teams app by uploading the manifest.zip file**
    
    1. In the File Explorer, go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > tab-adaptive-cards > csharp > TabWithAdpativeCardFlow > AppPackage** to open the folder.
    1. Open the `manifest.json` file in Visual Studio Code.
    1. In the `manifest.json` file, find **{contentBotId}** and add your Microsoft App ID and save.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/adaptive-cards/manifest-vsc.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the steps to configure manifest file.":::
        
    1. In the File Explorer, go to the **AppPackage** folder.
    1. Zip the contents of the **AppPackage** folder to create `manifest.zip`.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The `manifest.zip` shouldn't contain any additional folders in it. It should have **manifest** json source file, **color** icon, and **outline** icon inside the zip folder.

    1. Go to Teams.
    1. To upload `manifest.zip`, select **Store > Manage your apps > Upload a custom app** and open `manifest.zip`.
    1. Select **Add** to add the tab to your chat.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/adaptive-cards/tab-in-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the steps to add the tab to the chat.":::
        
        You can interact with this tab by signing in.

    1. Tab/fetch is the first invoke request that your bot receives when a user opens an Adaptive Card tab. When your bot receives the request, it either sends a tab continue response or a tab auth response.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/adaptive-cards/sample-task-module.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the sample task module.":::
        
    1. **Submit function of Adaptive Card**

    Webhooks help Teams to integrate with external apps. A webhook is essentially a POST request sent to a callback URL. In Teams, outgoing webhooks allow users to send messages to your web service without having to go through the full process of creating bots via the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/). Outgoing webhooks post data from Teams to any chosen service capable of accepting a JSON payload. Once an outgoing webhook is added to a team, it acts like bot, listening in channels for messages using @mention, sending notifications to external web services, and responding with rich messages that can include cards and images. 

    You'll see the following output:

    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

    * [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 3.1
    * [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
    * Asp.net Core
    * [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) latest version (only for devbox testing) or any equivalent tunneling solution
    
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).
    
    * [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/) with valid account
    * [SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/getting-started/tutorial-getting-started-with-signalr-and-mvc) to update agenda in real-time

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use version 1.7.0 or later of [Teams SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true), as versions prior to it do not support outgoing webhooks.

- title: Create an outgoing webhook
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |
    To create an outgoing webhook, perform the following steps:

    * Select the appropriate team and then select Manage team from the (•••) dropdown menu.

      ![Manage](~/assets/images/sbs-outgoing-webhooks/manage-team.png)

    * Choose the Apps tab from the navigation bar.

    * From the window's lower-right corner, select Create an outgoing webhook.

      ![outgoing](~/assets/images/sbs-outgoing-webhooks/create-outgoing-webhook.png)

    * In the resulting pop-up window, complete the required fields:

      ![Create outgoing webhook](~/assets/images/sbs-outgoing-webhooks/select.png)
    
        * Name - The webhook title and @mention tap.

        * Callback URL - The HTTPS endpoint that accepts JSON payloads and will receive POST requests from Teams.

            1. To use the api/sample or authenticated sample, do the following:

            * For api/sample, enter ngrok URL/api/sample.

            * For authenticated sample, enter ngrok URL/authenticatedSample?id=contoso.

        * Description - A detailed string that will appear in the profile card and the team-level App dashboard.

        * Profile Picture (optional) an app icon for your webhook.

        * Select the Create button from lower-right corner of the pop-up window and the outgoing webhook will be added to the current team's channels.

        * The next dialog window will display an [Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20129/how-and-when-do-i-use-hmac/20301) security token that will be used to authenticate calls between Teams and the designated outside service. This token in used in AuthProvider.cs.

          ![token](~/assets/images/sbs-outgoing-webhooks/security-token.png)
        * If the URL is valid and the server and client authentication tokens are equal (i.e., an HMAC handshake), the outgoing webhook will be available to the team's users.

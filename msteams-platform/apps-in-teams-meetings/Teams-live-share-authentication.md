# SDK authentication and access

Users can authenticate the SDK in several ways. All requests made through the SDK must have a valid API key, provided to the channel. The access token should only give access to the minimum number of data or capabilities.

The following are the different types of authentication:

* **Teams live share app - SDK authentication**
* **SDK - Teams live share app authentication**
* **Server OAuth 2.0**
* **Refresh token**
* **Invalidate token**

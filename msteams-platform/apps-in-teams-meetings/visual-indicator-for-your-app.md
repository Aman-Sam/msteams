# Visual indicator for your Teams app

The Visual indicator on the Ubar indicates the meeting participants don't miss any real-time information from meeting apps, even when the side panel is closed. The app calls meeting notification API, whenever there's new activity during the meeting, which displays a red indicator on the app icon in the meeting Ubar, seeking participants attention to the activity.

For example, a meeting participant A adds a new comment to a file during real-time collaboration, the app calls meeting notification API from meeting participant Aâ€™s side panel as soon as meeting participant A added the new comment. All other meeting participants can see the visual indicator on the app icon.

The following image shows you the visual indicator on the app icon in the meeting Ubar:

## Enable visual indicator for your Teams app

For a visual indicator, your Teams app must be integrated with bot SDK and have `meetingSidePanel` [context](build-tabs-for-meeting.md#context). The [targeted meeting notification API](in-meeting-notification-for-meeting.md#enable-targeted-in-meeting-notification) in bot SDK has been extended to support the visual indicator capability on the app icon and pass the MRI IDs of the intended recipients.

To enable visual indicator for your Teams app:

1. Add `meetingTabIcon` value in the `surfaces` parameter. You can also add the `tabEntityId`, if there are multiple instances of the app added to the same meeting. The following is an example of a payload:

    ```json
    {
        "type": "targetedMeetingNotification",
        "value": {
            "recipients": [
                "<participant1 MRI>",
                "<participant2 MRI>" 
            ],
            "surfaces": [
                {
                    "surface": "MeetingTabIcon",
                    "tabEntityId": "<tab id from tab sdk>" // optional           
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

If the `tabEntityId` isn't added, then Teams display the indicator on the first app icon on the users meeting window. The targeted meeting notification API already supports `meetingStage` surface and apps can define multiple surfaces in the same API call if there are relevant scenarios.

App can define the following objects under the `surface` parameter:

* `meetingTabIcon` which shows an indicator on the app icon.
* `meetingStage` which shows an in-meeting notification on the meeting stage for the same users.

## Limitations

* The visual indicator is displayed only one notification for a user in a minute per meeting.

* The visual indicator is displayed to a maximum of first 50 participants in the array for a particular meeting.

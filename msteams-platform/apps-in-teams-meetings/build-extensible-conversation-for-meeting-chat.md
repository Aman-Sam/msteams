# Build extensible conversation for meeting chat

App developers can make conversational extensible in Teams meetings. Bots, message extensions, cards and task modules can be combined to deliver an intuitive experience.

## Bots

A bot is also referred to as a chatbot or conversational bot. It is an app that runs simple and repetitive tasks by users such as customer service or support staff. Everyday use of bots include, bots that provide information about the weather, make dinner reservations, or provide travel information. Interactions with bots can be quick questions and answers or complex conversations.  Bots that are enabled in group chat scope start functioning in meetings. To implement bots, start with [Build a bot](/microsoftteams/platform//sbs-gs-javascript?tabs=vscode%2Cvsc%2Cviscode).

### Bot APIs

The [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) is a rich SDK used to create bots using C#, Java, Python, and JavaScript. If you already have a bot that is based on the Bot Framework, you can easily modify it to work in Teams. Use either C# or Node.js to take advantage of our [SDKs](/microsoftteams/platform/).

## Message extensions

Message extensions allow the users to interact with your web service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client. They can search or initiate actions in an external system from the compose message area, the command box, or directly from a message. You can send back the results of that interaction to the Teams client in the form of a richly formatted card.  Implementing message extensions for meeting chats is no different than regular chats. To implement message extension, start with [Message extensions](/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions?tabs=dotnet).

## Cards and Task modules

Cards provide users with various visual, audio, and selectable messages and help in conversation flow. With task modules, you can create modal pop-up experiences in Microsoft Teams. They're useful for starting and completing the tasks, or displaying rich information like videos or Power business intelligence (BI) dashboards. For more information, see [building cards and task modules](/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards-and-task-modules).

## User types in a meeting

The following list details the various user types along with their accessibility and performance:

* **In-tenant**: In-tenant users belong to the organization and have credentials in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for the tenant. They're full-time, onsite, or remote employees. An in-tenant user can be an organizer, presenter, or attendee.

* **Guest**: A guest is a participant from another organization invited to access Teams or other resources in the organization's tenant. Guests are added to the organizationâ€™s Azure AD and have same Teams capabilities as a native team member. They have access to team chats, meetings, and files. A guest can be an organizer, presenter, or attendee. For more information, see [guest access in Teams](/microsoftteams/guest-access).

* **Federated or external**: A federated user is an external Teams user in another organization who has been invited to join a meeting. Federated users have valid credentials with federated partners and are authorized by Teams. They don't have access to your teams or other shared resources from your organization. Guest access is a better option for external users to have access to teams and channels. For more information, see [manage external access in Teams](/microsoftteams/manage-external-access).

* **Anonymous**: Anonymous users don't have an Azure AD identity and aren't federated with a tenant. The anonymous participants are like external users, but their identity isn't shown in the meeting. Anonymous users can't access apps in a meeting window and meeting stage. An anonymous user can't be an organizer but can be a presenter or attendee.

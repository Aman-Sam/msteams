# Live Share FAQ

Get answers to common questions when using Live Share.<br>

<br>

<details>

<summary><b>Can I use my own Azure Fluid Relay service?</b></summary>

Yes! When constructing the `TeamsFluidClient` class, you can define your own `AzureConnectionConfig`. Live Share will still associate containers you create with meetings, but you will need to create your own Azure `ITokenProvider` to sign tokens for your containers and regional requirements. You can learn more by reading the Azure Fluid Relay [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-fluid-relay/).

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>How long is data stored in Live Share's hosted service accessible?</b></summary>

Any data sent or stored through Fluid containers created by Live Share's hosted Azure Fluid Relay service is accessible for 24 hours. If you want to persist data beyond 24 hours, you can replace our hosted Azure Fluid Relay service with your own. Alternatively, you can use your own storage provider in parallel to Live Share's hosted service.

<details>

<summary><b>What meeting types does Live Share support?</b></summary>

At this time, only scheduled meetings are supported and all participants must be on the meeting calendar. Support for other meeting types – including one-on-one calls, group calls, and meet now – are coming soon.

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Will Live Share's media package work with DRM content?</b></summary>

No. While we hope to eventually support DRM-licensed content such as WideVine and FairPlay, Teams does not currently support encrypted media for tab applications.

# Custom Together Mode scenes in Teams

> [!NOTE]
> Customer Together Mode scenes for Teams meetings are available in [public developer preview](../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md). Teams users need the [Teams Premium license](/microsoftteams/enhanced-teams-experience) to use Custom Together Mode after the preview.

Discover a new way to collaborate with Custom Together Mode scenes in Microsoft Teams. Custom Together Mode helps you create an immersive and engaging environment by digitally combining participants into a single virtual scene. The benefits of Custom Together Mode are as follows:

* Bring people together and encourage them to turn on their video.
* Combine participants digitally into a single virtual scene.
* Place the participant's video stream in predetermined seat designed and fixed by the scene creator.

Get started and transform your Teams meetings with Custom Together Mode scenes.

## Custom Together Mode scene

Custom Together Mode scene is an artifact and participants have seats with video streams in a conceived scene setting, and the videos are rendered in those seats. You can create a scene using Microsoft Scene studio. Scene studio handles the app package creation in the background and creates a scene only app. We recommended to use scene only apps for better experience.

> [!NOTE]
  >
  > * Users can't initiate Custom Together Mode on a mobile. However, if they join a meeting through mobile and Together Mode is enabled on desktop, their mobile video appears in Together Mode on desktop.
  > * Multiple scenes in a single app package appear as a flat list to the users.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you must be familiar with the following prerequisites:

* Scene and [elements of a scene](#elements-of-a-scene)
* [Microsoft Developer account](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
* [Teams Developer Portal](../concepts/build-and-test/teams-developer-portal.md)
* [Upload your app in Teams](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload.md)

Ensure that the administrator has granted permission to [upload a custom app](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload.md#upload-your-app) and select all filters as part of app setup and meeting policies respectively.

## Best practices

To create a best scene, ensure that you follow the following practices:

* Ensure that all images are in PNG format.
* Ensure that the images in final package mustn't exceed 1920 x 1080 resolution. The resolution is an even number. This resolution is a requirement for scenes to be shown successfully.
* Ensure that the maximum scene size is within 10 MB.
* Ensure that the maximum size of each image is within 5 MB. A scene is a collection of multiple images. This limit is for each individual image.
* From the right pane, select **Transparent** checkbox when an image is selected to indicate that the images are overlapping images in the scene.

## Build a scene using the Scene studio

You can build a scene using [Scenes Studio](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/scenes) in Teams Developer Portal. A scene in the context of the Scene studio contains the following elements:

* Seats reserved for meeting organizer and meeting presenters. The presenter doesn't refer to the user who is actively sharing. For more information, see [meeting role](https://support.microsoft.com/office/roles-in-a-teams-meeting-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

* Seat and image for each participant with an adjustable width and height.

* Seat and image XYZ coordinates.

* Collection of images that are camouflaged as one image.

The following image shows each participant in a scene:

### Elements of a scene

A scene consists of bitmap images, sprites, and rectangles to put participant videos in the Custom Together mode. The following are the elements of a scene:

|Value|Description|
|---|---|
| **Scene:** | Each scene has a unique ID and name. A scene.json file along with the images indicate the exact position of the seats. The scene.json file also contains information on all the assets used for the scene. |
| **Asset:** | Each asset contains a filename, width, height, and position on the X and Y-axis. |
| **Participants:** | Each participant has their own video feed, which is segmented to render only the foreground. Custom Together Mode scenes support **ZoomIn** in on the current meeting participants. |
| **Seat:** | Each seat contains a seat ID, width, height, and position on the X and Y-axis. The seating order is automatically generated and is altered according to preference. The seating order number corresponds to the order of people joining the call. |

Ensure to go through the following list while creating a scene:

|Value|Description|
|---|---|
| Sprite | A Sprite is a static bitmap image positioned in the world. These sprites and participant boxes are defined in a world coordinate system. |
| **X**-axis | The X-axis points to the right. |
| **Y**-axis | The Y-axis points downwards. |
| `zOrder` | The `zOrder` represents the order of placing images and seats along the Z-axis. It gives a sense of depth or partition if necessary. It determines the position of the sprite See the step-by-step getting started sample. The sample uses the `zOrder`. |

For more information, see [example](#example).

## Test Custom Together Mode scenes in Teams

Before you start, you must create a new Teams meeting to test and launch Custom Together Mode scenes in Teams.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can apply a Custom Together Mode scene that is deployed by your tenant admin only if you've a [Teams Premium license](/MicrosoftTeams/enhanced-teams-experience?branch=danismith-t-pre-licensing).

Join the Teams meeting and follow the steps to test the Custom Together Mode:

1. In Teams meeting window, select **View** and select **Together Mode** from the drop-down list.

1. In the **Select a scene** window, select the scene you've added to Teams from Scene studio.

1. Select **Assign seats** to assign specific seats for meeting participants.

1. In the **Select a participant** section, from **In this meeting**, select the participant and in  the **Choose a seat** section, select a seat for the participant.

1. Select **Assign**.

1. Select **Apply**. Teams installs the app for the user and applies the scene.

    Optionally, the meeting organizer and presenter can select **View** > **Change scene** in the meeting.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Only one scene is used uniformly for the entire meeting. If a presenter or organizer changes the scene, it changes for everyone. Participants can switch in or out of Custom Together Mode scenes individually, but when using Custom Together Mode scenes, all participants share the same scene.

1. The meeting organizer and presenter can select **View** > **Change scene** in the meeting to select any existing scene available.

## Share a scene using the Scene studio

You can view the scene you've created in the **Your scenes** section of **Scene studio**. Additionally, you can share and export the scene.

To share a scene, follow the steps:

1. From the **Save** drop-down menu, select **Share**.

1. In **Share the scene app** window, select **Share Test together mode with everyone** toggle to create a shareable link of your scenes to share for others to use.

1. **Copy** the link.

    The user can open the link to install the scene and start using it. After preview, the scene is shipped as an app to Teams by following the steps for app submission. This step requires the app package. For the scene that is designed, the app package is different from the scene package. The app package created automatically is found in the **Apps** section in the Teams Developer Center. </br>

To export a scene, Follow the steps:

1. In Scene studio, in the upper-right corner, select **Save**.
1. Select **Export** from the dropdown list to retrieve the scene package.
   A .zip file, which is the scene package, is downloaded. The Scene package includes a scene.json and the PNG assets used to build a scene. The scene package is reviewed for incorporating other changes. </br>

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/apps-in-meetings/build-a-scene.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Export option to export a scene.":::

To delete a scene you created, select **Delete scene**.

### Import and share a scene package

You can share the scene package, which is a .zip file retrieved from the Scene studio to other creators to further enhance the scene.

1. Select **Import a scene**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/apps-in-meetings/scene-zip-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Import a scene option highlighted in red in scene studio.":::

1. Select the scene package file you wish to import.
   This functionality helps you to unwrap a scene package and enhance the scene.

## Example

The following sample demonstrates a complex scene that utilizes the Z-axis:

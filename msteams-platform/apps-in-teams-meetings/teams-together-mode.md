# Custom Together Mode scenes in Teams

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently available in [public developer preview](../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md) only.

Custom Together Mode scenes in Microsoft Teams provides an immersive and engaging meeting environment that brings people together and encourages them to turn on their video. It digitally combines participants into a single virtual scene and places their video streams in pre-determined seats designed and fixed by the scene creator.

A scene in custom Together Mode scenes is an artifact created by the scene developer using the Microsoft Scene studio. In a conceived scene setting, participants have designated seats with video streams rendered in those seats.

> [!NOTE]
> Scene only apps are recommended as the acquisition experience for such apps is more seamless.

The following process gives an overview to create a scene only app:

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/apps-in-meetings/create-together-mode-scene-flow.png" alt-text="Create scene only app" border="false":::

> [!NOTE]
> * A scene only app is still an app in Microsoft Teams. The Scene studio handles the app package creation in the background.
> * Multiple scenes in a single app package appear as a flat list of scenes to users.

## Prerequisites

You must have a basic understanding of the following to use custom Together Mode scenes:

* Definition of scene and seats in a scene.
* Have a Microsoft Developer account and be familiar with the Microsoft Teams [Developer Portal](../concepts/build-and-test/teams-developer-portal.md) and App Studio.
* [Concept of app sideloading](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload.md).
* Ensure that the Administrator has granted permission to **Upload a custom app** and to select all filters as part of App Setup and Meeting policies respectively.

## Best practices

Prior to building a scene, consider the following to have a seamless scene building experience:

* Ensure that all images are in PNG format.
* Ensure that the final package with all the images put together must not exceed 1920x1080 resolution.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The resolution is an even number. This is a requirement for scenes to be lit up successfully.

* Ensure that the maximum scene size is 10 MB.
* Ensure that the maximum size of each image is 5 MB.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * A scene is a collection of multiple images. The limit is for each individual image.
    > * The individual image resolution must also be an even number.
  
* Ensure that the **Transparent** checkbox is selected if the image is transparent. This checkbox is available on the right panel when an image is selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Overlapping images need to be marked as **Transparent** to indicate that they are overlapping images in the scene.

## Build a scene using the Scene studio

Microsoft has a Scene studio that allows you to build scenes. It is available on [Scenes Editor - Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/scenes).

> [!NOTE]
> This document is referring to Scene studio in the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal. The interface and functionalities are all the same in App Studio Scene Designer.

A scene in the context of the Scene studio is an artifact that contains the following:

* Seats reserved for meeting organizer and meeting presenters.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Presenter does not refer to the user who is actively sharing. It refers to the [meeting role](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/roles-in-a-teams-meeting-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

* Seat and image for each participant with an adjustable width and height.

    > [!NOTE]
    > PNG is the only supported format.

* XYZ coordinates of all the seats and images.
* Collection of images that are camouflaged as one image.

The seat dimensions become the canvas for rendering the participant video stream. The following image shows each seat represented as an avatar for building scenes:

**To build a scene using the Scene studio**

1. Go to [Scenes Editor - Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/scenes).

    >[!NOTE]
    > * To open Scene studio, you can navigate to the home page of [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home) and select **Create custom scenes for meetings**.
    > * To open Scene studio, you can navigate to the home page of [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home), select **Tools** from the left hand section, and select **Scene studio** from the **Tools** section.

1. In the **Scenes Editor** page, select **Create a new scene**.

1. In the **Scene** box, enter a name for the scene.

    >[!NOTE]
    > * You can select **Close** to toggle between closing or reopening the right pane.
    > * You can zoom in or zoom out of the scene using the zoom bar for a better view of the scene.

1. Drag and drop the image into the environment as displayed in the following image:

    >[!NOTE]
    > * You can download the [SampleScene.zip](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/msteams-docs/tree/master/msteams-platform/apps-in-teams-meetings/SampleScene.zip) and [SampleApp.zip](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/msteams-docs/tree/master/msteams-platform/apps-in-teams-meetings/SampleApp.zip) files with the images.
    > * Alternately, you can add background images to the scene using **Add images**.

    ![Drag into the scene](../assets/images/apps-in-meetings/drag-and-drop-scene.png)

1. Select the image that you have placed.

1. From the right pane, select an alignment for the image or use the **Resize** slider to adjust the image size.

    ![Alignment for images](../assets/images/apps-in-meetings/image-alignment.png)

1. Select an area outside of the image.

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Participants** under **Layers**.

1. Select the number of participants for the scene from the **Number of participants** box, and select **Add**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > * After the scene is shipped, the avatar placements are replaced with actual participant's video streams.
    > * You can drag the participant images around the scene and place them in the required position and resize them using the resize arrow.

1. Select any participant image, and select the **Assign Spot** check box to assign the spot to the participant.

1. Select **Meeting Organizer** or **Presenter** role for the participant.

    >[!NOTE]
    > In a meeting, one participant must be assigned the role of a meeting organizer.

    ![Assign spot](../assets/images/apps-in-meetings/assign-spot.png)

1. Select **Save** and select **View in Teams** to quickly test your scene in Microsoft Teams.

    >[!NOTE]
    > To delete a scene you created, select **Delete scene** on the top bar.

1. In the **View in Teams** dialog box, select **Preview in Teams**.
1. In the dialog box that appears, select **Add**.

    The scene can be tested or accessed by creating a test meeting and launching custom Together Mode scenes. For more information, see [activate custom Together Mode scenes](#activate-custom-together-mode-scenes).

    ![Launch custom Together Mode scenes](../assets/images/apps-in-meetings/launchtogethermode.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    > * Selecting **Preview** automatically creates a Microsoft Teams app that can be viewed in the **Apps** page in the Teams Developer Portal.
    > * Selecting **Preview** automatically creates an app package that is appmanifest.json behind the scene. As stated earlier, this is abstracted, but you can access the automatically created app package by navigating to **Apps** from the menu.
    > * The scene can then be viewed in the custom Together Mode scenes gallery.

1. Optionally, you can select **Share** from the **Save** drop-down menu to create a shareable link to easily distribute your scenes for others to use. Opening this link installs the scene for the user and they can start using it.

1. After preview, the scene can be shipped as an app to Teams by following the steps for app submission.

    >[!NOTE]
    > This step requires the app package that is different from the scene package, for the scene that was designed. The app package created automatically can be found in the **Apps** section in the Teams Developer Center.

1. Optionally, the scene package can be retrieved by selecting **Export** from the **Save** drop-down menu. A .zip file, that is the scene package, is downloaded.

    ![Export a scene](../assets/images/apps-in-meetings/build-a-scene.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    > Scene package comprises of a scene.json and the PNG assets used to build a scene. The scene package can be reviewed for incorporating other changes as described in the Sample scene.json section of this document.

A more complex scene that leverages the Z-axis is demonstrated in the step-by-step getting started sample.

## Sample scene.json

Scene.json along with the images indicate the exact position of the seats. A scene consists of bitmap images, sprites, and rectangles to put participant videos in. These sprites and participant boxes are defined in a world coordinate system with the X-axis pointing to the right and the Y-axis pointing downwards. Custom Together Mode scenes supports zooming in on the current participants. This is helpful for small meetings in a large scene. A sprite is a static bitmap image positioned in the world. The Z value of the sprite determines the position of the sprite. Rendering starts with the sprite with lowest Z value, so higher Z value means it is closer to the camera. Each participant has its own video feed, which is segmented so that only the foreground is rendered.

Following is the scene.json sample:

```json
{
   "protocolVersion": "1.0",
   "id": "A",
   "autoZoom": true,
   "mirrorParticipants ": true,
   "extent":{
      "left":0.0,
      "top":0.0,
      "width":16.0,
      "height":9.0
   },
   "sprites":[
      {
         "filename":"background.png",
         "cx":8.0,
         "cy":4.5,
         "width":16.0,
         "height":9.0,
         "zOrder":0.0,
   "isAlpha":false
      },
      {
         "filename":"table.png",
         "cx":8.0,
         "cy":7.0,
         "width":12.0,
         "height":4.0,
         "zOrder":3.0,
   "isAlpha":true
      },
      {
         "filename":"row0.png",
         "cx":12.0,
         "cy":15.0,
         "width":8.0,
         "height":4.0,
         "zOrder":2.0,
   "isAlpha":true
      }

   ],
   "participants":[
      {
         "cx":5.0,
         "cy":4.0,
         "width":4.0,
         "height":2.25,
         "zOrder":1.0,
         "seatingOrder":0
      },
      {
         "cx":11.0,
         "cy":4.0,
         "width":4.0,
         "height":2.25,
         "zOrder":1.0,
         "seatingOrder":1
      }
   ]
}
```

Each scene has a unique ID and name. The scene JSON also contains information on all the assets used for the scene. Each asset contains a filename, width, height, and position on the X and Y-axis. Similarly, each seat contains a seat ID, width, height, and position on the X and Y-axis. The seating order is generated automatically and can be altered as per preference.

> [!NOTE]
> Seating order number corresponds to the order of people joining the call.

The zOrder represents the order of placing images and seats along the Z-axis. In many cases, it gives a sense of depth or partition if required. For more information, see the step-by-step getting started sample. The sample leverages the zOrder.

Now that you have gone through the sample scene.json, you can activate the custom Together Mode scenes to engage in scenes.

## Activate custom Together Mode scenes

Get end-to-end information of how an end user engages with scenes in custom Together Mode scenes.

**To select scenes and activate custom Together Mode scenes**

1. Create a new test meeting.

    >[!NOTE]
    > On selecting **Preview** in the Scene studio, the scene is installed as an app in Microsoft Teams. This is the model for a developer to test and try out scenes from the Scene studio. After a scene is shipped as an app, users see these scenes in the scene gallery.

1. From the **Gallery** drop-down in the upper-left corner, select **Together Mode**. The **Picker** dialog box appears and the scene that is added is available.

1. Select **Change scene** to change the default scene.

1. From the **Scene Gallery**, select the scene you want to use for your meeting.

1. Optionally, the meeting organizer and presenter can **Change scene for all participants** in the meeting.

    >[!NOTE]
    > At any point in time, only one scene can be used homogeneously for the meeting. If a presenter or organizer changes a scene, it  changes for all. Switching in or out of custom Together Mode scenes is up to individual participants, but while in custom Together Mode scenes, all participants have the same scene.

1. Select **Apply**. Teams installs the app for the user and applies the scene.

## Open a custom Together Mode scenes Scene Package

You can share the Scene Package that is a .zip file retrieved from the Scene studio to other creators to further enhance the scene. The **Import a Scene** functionality can be leveraged. This tool helps unwrap a scene package to let the creator continue building the scene.

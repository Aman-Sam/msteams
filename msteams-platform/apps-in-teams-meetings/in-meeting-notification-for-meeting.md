# Build in-meeting notification for Teams meeting

The in-meeting notification is used to engage participants and collect information or feedback during the meeting. Use an [in-meeting notification payload](meeting-apps-apis.md#send-an-in-meeting-notification) to trigger an in-meeting notification. As part of the notification payload request, include the URL where the content to be shown is hosted.

An external resource URL is used to display in-meeting notification. You can use the `submitTask` method to submit data in a meeting chat.

  # [Desktop](#tab/desktop)

  The following image shows an in-meeting notification sent during a meeting in the Teams desktop client:

  # [Mobile](#tab/mobile)

  The following image shows an in-meeting notification sent during a meeting in the Teams mobile client:

You can also add the Teams display picture and people card of the user to in-meeting notification based on `onBehalfOf` token with user MRI and display name passed in payload. Following is an example payload:

```json
    {
       "type": "message",
       "text": "John Phillips assigned you a weekly todo",
       "summary": "Don't forget to meet with Marketing next week",
       "channelData": {
           onBehalfOf: [
             { 
               itemId: 0, 
               mentionType: 'person', 
               mri: context.activity.from.id, 
               displayname: context.activity.from.name 
             }
            ],
           "notification": {
           "alertInMeeting": true,
           "externalResourceUrl": "https://teams.microsoft.com/l/bubble/APP_ID?url=<url>&height=<height>&width=<width>&title=<title>&completionBotId=BOT_APP_ID"
            }
        },
       "replyToId": "1493070356924"
    }
```

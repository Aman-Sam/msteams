# Create apps for Teams meetings (Developer Preview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Features included in Microsoft Teams Developer Preview are provided for early-access, testing, and feedback purposes only. They may undergo changes before becoming available in the public release and should not be used in production applications.

## Prerequisites and considerations

1. Apps in meetings require some basic knowledge of [Teams app development](../overview.md). An app in a meeting can comprise of [tabs](../tabs/what-are-tabs.md), [bots](../bots/what-are-bots.md), and [messaging extensions](../messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions.md) features and will require updates to the Teams [app manifest](#update-your-app-manifest) to indicate that the app is available for meetings

1. For your app to function in the meeting lifecycle as a tab, it must support configurable tabs in the [groupchat scope](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#configurabletabs). *See* [Extend your Teams app with a custom tab](../tabs/how-to/add-tab.md). Supporting the `groupchat` scope will enable your app in [pre-meeting](teams-apps-in-meetings.md#pre-meeting-app-experience) and [post-meeting](teams-apps-in-meetings.md#post-meeting-app-experience) chats.

1. Meeting API URL parameters may require `meetingId`, `userId`, and the [tenantId](/onedrive/find-your-office-365-tenant-id) These are available as part of the Teams Client SDK and bot activity. Additionally, reliable information for user ID and tenant ID can be retrieved using [Tab SSO authentication](../tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso.md).

1. Some meeting APIs, such as `GetParticipant` will require a [bot registration and bot app ID](../bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams.md#with-an-azure-subscription) to generate auth tokens.

1. Developers must adhere to general [Teams tab design guidelines](../tabs/design/tabs.md) for pre- and post-meeting scenarios as well as the [in-meeting dialog guidelines](design/designing-in-meeting-dialog.md) for in-meeting dialog triggered during a Teams meeting.

## Meeting apps API reference

|API|Description|Request|Source|
|---|---|----|---|
|**GetUserContext**| Get contextual information to display relevant content in a Teams tab. |_**microsoftTeams.getContext( ( ) => {  /*...*/ } )**_|Microsoft Teams client SDK|
|**GetParticipant**|This API allows a bot to fetch a participant information by meeting id and participant id.|**GET** _**/v1/meetings/{meetingId}/participants/{participantId}?tenantId={tenantId}**_ |Microsoft Bot Framework SDK|
|**NotificationSignal** |Meeting signals will be delivered using the following existing conversation notification API (for user-bot chat). This API allows developers to signal based on end-user action to show-case an in-meeting dialog bubble.|**POST** _**/v3/conversations/{conversationId}/activities**_|Microsoft Bot Framework SDK|

### GetUserContext

Please refer to our [Get context for your Teams tab](../tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md#getting-context-by-using-the-microsoft-teams-javascript-library) documentation for guidance on identifying and  retrieving contextual information for your tab content. As part of meetings extensibility, a new value has been added for the response payload:

✔ **meetingId**: used by a tab when running in the meeting context.

### GetParticipant API

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Do not cache participant roles since the meeting organizer can change a role at any point in time.
>
> * Teams does not currently support large distribution lists or roster sizes of more than 350 participants for the `GetParticipant` API.
>
> * Support for the Bot Framework SDK is coming soon.

#### Request

```http
GET /v3/meetings/{meetingId}/participants/{participantId}?tenantId={tenantId}
```

*See* the [Bot Framework API reference](/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-connector-api-reference?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true).

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD025 -->

**C# Example**

```csharp
string meetingId = "meetingid?";
string participantId = "participantidhere";
var connectorClient = turnContext.TurnState.Get<IConnectorClient>();
var creds = connectorClient.Credentials as AppCredentials;
var bearerToken = await creds.GetTokenAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
var request = new HttpRequestMessage();
request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", bearerToken);
request.Method = new HttpMethod("GET");
request.RequestUri = new System.Uri(Path.Combine(connectorClient.BaseUri.OriginalString, $"/meetings/{meetingId}/participants/{participantId}"));
HttpResponseMessage response = await (connectorClient as ServiceClient<ConnectorClient>).HttpClient.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
{
    var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
    var theObject = Rest.Serialization.SafeJsonConvert.DeserializeObject<WhateverObjectIsReturned>(content, connectorClient.DeserializationSettings);
}
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

```json
{
    "type": "message",
    "text": "John Phillips assigned you a weekly todo",
    "summary": "Don't forget to meet with Marketing next week",
    "channelData": {
        "notification": {
            "alertInMeeting": true,
            "externalResourceUrl": "https://teams.microsoft.com/l/bubble/APP_ID?url=<TaskInfo.url>&height=<TaskInfo.height>&width=<TaskInfo.width>&title=<TaskInfo.title>&completionBotId=BOT_APP_ID"
        }
    },
    "replyToId": "1493070356924"
}
```

# [C#/.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
Activity activity = MessageFactory.Text("This is a meeting signal test");
MeetingNotification notification = new MeetingNotification
  {
    AlertInMeeting = true,
    ExternalResourceUrl = "https://teams.microsoft.com/l/bubble/APP_ID?url=<TaskInfo.url>&height=<TaskInfo.height>&width=<TaskInfo.width>&title=<TaskInfo.title>&completionBotId=BOT_APP_ID"
  };
activity.ChannelData = new TeamsChannelData
  {
    Notification = notification
  };
await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(activity).ConfigureAwait(false);
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript

const replyActivity = MessageFactory.text('Hi'); // this could be an adaptive card instead
replyActivity.channelData = {
    notification: {
        alertInMeeting: true,
        externalResourceUrl: 'https://teams.microsoft.com/l/bubble/APP_ID?url=<TaskInfo.url>&height=<TaskInfo.height>&width=<TaskInfo.width>&title=<TaskInfo.title>&completionBotId=BOT_APP_ID’
    }
};
await context.sendActivity(replyActivity);
```

* * *

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The URL in the content bubble (taskInfo URL) must be included in the [valid domains](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#validdomains) list included in the Teams app manifest.

#### Response Codes

**201**: activity with signal is successfully sent  
**401**: invalid token  
**403**: the app is not allowed to send the signal. In this case, the payload should contain more detail error message. There can be many reasons: app disabled by tenant admin, blocked during live site mitigation, etc.  
**404**: meeting chat doesn't exist  

## Enable your app for Teams meetings

### Update your app manifest

The meetings app capabilities are declared in your app manifest via the **configurableTabs** -> **scopes** and **context** arrays. *Scope* defines to whom and *context* defines where your app will be available.

> [!NOTE]
> * Please use [Developer Preview manifest schema](../resources/schema/manifest-schema-dev-preview.md) to try this in your app manifest.

```json
"configurableTabs": [
    {
      "configurationUrl": "https://contoso.com/teamstab/configure",
      "canUpdateConfiguration": true,
      "scopes": [
        "team",
        "groupchat"
      ],
      "context":[
        "channelTab",
        "privateChatTab",
        "meetingChatTab",
        "meetingDetailsTab",
        "meetingSidePanel"
     ]
    }
  ]
```

### Context property

The tab `context` and `scopes` properties work in harmony to allow you to determine where you want your app to appear. Tabs in the `team` or `groupchat` scope can have more than one context. The possible values for the context property are as follows:

* **channelTab**: a tab in the header of a team channel.
* **privateChatTab**: a tab in the header of a group chat between a set of users not in the context of a team or meeting.
* **meetingChatTab**: a tab in the header of a group chat between a set of users in the context of a scheduled meeting.
* **meetingDetailsTab**: a tab in the header of the meeting details view of the calendar.
* **meetingSidePanel**: an in-meeting panel opened via the unified bar (u-bar).

> [!NOTE]
> "Context" property is currently not supported and thus will be ignored on mobile clients

## Configure your app for meeting scenarios

> [!NOTE]
> * For your app to be visible in the tab gallery it needs to **support configurable tabs** and the **group chat scope**.
>
> * Mobile clients support Tabs only in Pre and Post Meeting Surfaces. The In-meeting experiences (in-meeting dialog and panel) on mobile will be available soon. Follow the [guidance for tabs on mobile](../tabs/design/tabs-mobile.md) when creating your tabs for mobile. 

### Pre-meeting

Users with organizer and/or presenter roles add tabs to a meeting using the plus ➕ button in the meeting **Chat** and meeting **details** pages. Messaging extensions are added to via the ellipses/overflow menu &#x25CF;&#x25CF;&#x25CF; located beneath the compose message area in the chat. Bots are added to a meeting chat using the "**@**" key and selecting **Get bots**.

✔ The user identity *must* be confirmed via [Tabs SSO](../tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso.md). Following this authentication, the app can retrieve the user role via the GetParticipant API.

 ✔ Based on the user role, the app will now have the capability to present role specific experiences. For example, a polling app can allow only organizers and presenters to create a new poll.

> **NOTE**: Role assignments can be changed while a meeting is in progress.  *See* [Roles in a Teams meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/roles-in-a-teams-meeting-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019). 

### In-meeting

#### **sidePanel**

✔ In your app manifest add **sidePanel** to the **context** array as described above.

✔ In the meeting as well as in all scenarios, the app will be rendered in an in-meeting tab that is 320px in width. Your tab must be optimized for this. *See*, [FrameContext interface](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/microsoftteams.framecontext?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true)

✔Refer to the [Teams SDK](../tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md#user-context) to use the **userContext** API to route requests accordingly.

✔ Refer to the [Teams authentication flow for tabs](../tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-flow-tab.md). Authentication flow for tabs is very similar to the auth flow for websites. Thus, tabs can use OAuth 2.0 directly. *See also*, [Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).

#### **in-meeting dialog**

✔ You must adhere to the [in-meeting dialog design guidelines](design/designing-in-meeting-dialog.md).

✔ Refer to the [Teams authentication flow for tabs](../tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-flow-tab.md).

✔ Use the [notification](/graph/api/resources/notifications-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) API to signal that a bubble notification needs to be triggered.

✔ As part of the notification request payload, include the URL where the content to be showcased is hosted.

✔ 

> [!NOTE]
>
> * In-meeting dialog must not use task module.
>
> * These notifications are persistent in nature. You must invoke the [**submitTask()**](../task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/task-modules-bots.md#submitting-the-result-of-a-task-module) function to auto-dismiss after a user takes an action in the web-view. This is a requirement for app submission. *See also*, [Teams SDK: task module](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/microsoftteams.tasks?view=msteams-client-js-latest#submittask-string---object--string---string---&preserve-view=true).
>
> * If you want your app to support anonymous users, your initial invoke request payload must rely on the `from.id`  (ID of the user) request metadata in the `from` object, not the `from.aadObjectId` (Azure Active Directory ID of the user) request metadata. *See* [Using task modules in tabs](../task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/task-modules-tabs.md) and [Create and send the task module](../messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/create-task-module.md?tabs=dotnet#the-initial-invoke-request).

### Post-meeting

The post-meeting and pre-meeting configurations are equivalent.

# Custom Azure Fluid Relay service

While you likely will prefer using our free hosted service, there are situations where it's beneficial to use your own Azure Fluid Relay service for your Live Share app.

## Pre-requisites

1. Build a meeting side panel and stage app meeting extension, as shown in the [dice roller tutorial](../teams-live-share-tutorial.md).
2. Update your app manifest to include all [necessary permissions](../teams-live-share-capabilities.md#register-rsc-permissions).
3. Provision an Azure Fluid Relay service as outlined in this [tutorial](/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/provision-fluid-azure-portal).

## Connect to Azure Fluid Relay service

When calling initializing `LiveShareClient`, you can define your own `AzureConnectionConfig`. Live Share associates containers you create with meetings, but you'll need to implement the `ITokenProvider` interface to sign tokens for your containers. This example explains Azure's `AzureFunctionTokenProvider`, which uses an Azure cloud function to request an access token from a server.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
import { LiveShareClient, LivePresence } from "@microsoft/live-share";
import { SharedMap } from "fluid-framework";
import { AzureFunctionTokenProvider } from "@fluidframework/azure-client";

// Define a custom connection for your app
const options = {
  connection: {
    tenantId: "MY_TENANT_ID",
    tokenProvider: new AzureFunctionTokenProvider(
      "MY_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL" + "/api/GetAzureToken",
      { userId: "userId", userName: "Test User" }
    ),
    endpoint: "MY_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL",
    type: "remote",
  },
};
// Join the Fluid container
const liveShare = new LiveShareClient(options);
const schema = {
  initialObjects: {
    presence: LivePresence,
    ticTacToePositions: SharedMap,
  },
};
const { container } = await liveShare.joinContainer(schema);

// ... ready to start app sync logic
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```TypeScript
import {
  LiveShareClient,
  ILiveShareClientOptions,
  LivePresence,
} from "@microsoft/live-share";
import { SharedMap } from "fluid-framework";
import { AzureFunctionTokenProvider } from "@fluidframework/azure-client";

// Define a custom connection for your app
const options: ILiveShareClientOptions = {
  connection: {
    tenantId: "MY_TENANT_ID",
    tokenProvider: new AzureFunctionTokenProvider(
      "MY_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT_URL" + "/api/GetAzureToken",
      { userId: "userId", userName: "Test User" }
    ),
    endpoint: "MY_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL",
    type: "remote",
  },
};
// Join the Fluid container
const liveShare = new LiveShareClient(options);
const schema = {
  initialObjects: {
    presence: LivePresence,
    ticTacToePositions: SharedMap,
  },
};
const { container } = await liveShare.joinContainer(schema);

// ... ready to start app sync logic
```

## Why use a custom Azure Fluid Relay service?

Consider using a custom AFR service connection if you:

* Require storage of data in Fluid containers beyond the lifetime of a meeting.
* Transmit sensitive data through the service that requires a custom security policy.
* Develop features through Fluid Framework for your application outside of Teams.

## Why use Live Share with your custom service?

Azure Fluid Relay is designed to work with any web-based application, meaning it works with or without Microsoft Teams. That raises an important question: if I build my own Azure Fluid Relay service, do I still need Live Share?

Live Share has features that are beneficial to common meeting scenarios that augment other features in your app, including:

* [Container mapping](#container-mapping)
* [Live objects and role verification](#live-objects-and-role-verification)
* [Media synchronization](#media-synchronization)

### Container mapping

The `LiveShareClient` in `@microsoft/live-share` is responsible for mapping a unique meeting identifier to your Fluid containers, which ensures that all meeting participants join the same container. As part of this process, the client attempts to connect to a `containerId` mapped to the meeting that one already exists. If one doesn't exist, the `AzureClient` is used to create a container using your `AzureConnectionConfig` and then relay the `containerId` to other meeting participants.

If your app already has a mechanism for creating Fluid containers and sharing them to other members, such as by inserting the `containerId` into the URL shared to the meeting stage, then this may not be necessary for your app.

### Live objects and role verification

Live Share's live data structures such as `LivePresence`, `LiveState`, and `LiveEvent` are tailored to collaboration in meetings and thus aren't supported in Fluid containers used outside of Microsoft Teams. Features like role verification help your app align with expectations of our users.

> [!NOTE]
> As an added benefit, live objects also feature faster message latencies compared to traditional Fluid data structures.

For more information, see [core capabilities](../teams-live-share-capabilities.md) page.

### Media synchronization

Packages from `@microsoft/live-share-media` aren't supported in Fluid containers used outside of Microsoft Teams.

For more information, see [media capabilities](../teams-live-share-media-capabilities.md) page.

# Introduction

This article describes how to use hyperlinks. Hyperlinks can connect two different documents as well as various sections in the same document.

Following are the three different types of links:

> * Bookmark links
> * Links from one article to another within the docset 
> * External links

## Link text

The words that you write in the link text should be user friendly. This is the text that appears in the document as a link.

## Bookmark links

For a bookmark link to a heading in the current file, use a hash symbol followed by the lowercase words of the heading.

`[Before a meeting](#before-a-meeting)`

## Links from one article to another within the docset

A file can link to other file within the docset using `/` symbol. It helps to divide all the file paths.

`[link text](../directory/article-name.md)`

## External links

Use URL links when linking to content outside of the current docset.

`[External link](https://.........)`

# Apps for Teams meetings and calls

Meetings enable collaboration, partnership, informed communication, and shared feedback. The meeting app can deliver a user experience for each stage of the meeting lifecycle. Meeting lifecycle includes pre-meeting, in-meeting, and post-meeting app experience, depending on the attendee's status.

> [!Note]
>
> Apps for instant meetings, scheduled public channel meetings, one-on-one, and group calls are currently available only in [public developer preview](../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

Teams supports access to apps during meeting for the following meeting types:

* [**Scheduled meetings**](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-meeting-in-teams-943507a9-8583-4c58-b5d2-8ec8265e04e5#ID0EFBD=Desktop): Meetings scheduled through Teams calendar.
* [**Scheduled channel meetings**](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-meeting-in-teams-943507a9-8583-4c58-b5d2-8ec8265e04e5#ID0EFBD=Desktop): Meetings scheduled through Teams public channels.
* [**One-on-one calls**](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-a-call-from-a-chat-in-teams-f5138c9d-df4c-43d8-9cf6-53400c1a7798): Calls initiated in one-on-one chat.
* [**Group calls**](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-a-call-from-a-chat-in-teams-f5138c9d-df4c-43d8-9cf6-53400c1a7798): Calls initiated in group chat.
* [**Instant meetings**](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-an-instant-meeting-in-teams-ff95e53f-8231-4739-87fa-00b9723f4ef5): Meetings initiated through **Meet now** button in Teams calendar.

Users can add apps to the meeting using the **+** option from their Teams meeting window.

Visit the [Teams store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=2183121) and explore apps designed specifically for meetings.

> [!Note]
>
> * Currently, adding an app is not supported in mobile. However, a user can view the app and share the app to stage from mobile.
>
> * Currently when a third person is added to a one-on-one call, the call is elevated to a group call that means a new session starts. Apps added to the one-on-one call are not available in the group call. However, they can be added again.
>
> * Currently app experiences are not supported in Teams instant channel meetings.

The following illustration gives you an idea of the meeting app extensibility features:

![Meeting app extensibility](../assets/images/apps-in-meetings/meetingappextensibility.png)

This article provides an overview of meeting app extensibility, API references, enable and configure apps for meetings, and custom Together Mode scenes in Teams.

* **Extend meeting app**: Enhance your meeting experience by using the meeting extensibility feature. This feature enables you to integrate your apps within meetings. It also includes different stages of a meeting lifecycle, where you can integrate tabs, bots, and message extensions. You can identify various participant roles and user types, get meeting events, and generate in-meeting dialogs.
* **Configure apps for meetings**: To customize Teams with apps for meetings, enable your apps for Teams meetings by updating the app manifest and also configure the apps for meeting scenarios.
* **Customize with Together Mode scenes**: The new custom Together Mode scenes feature enables users to collaborate in a meeting with their team in one place.
* **Customize app permission in shared channel: If your app shares important information in shared channel, you can customize the app permission for external members. App permissions in [Shared channels](../concepts/build-and-test/Shared-channels.md) follow host team's app roster and host tenant's app policy.
* **Retrieve meeting transcripts**: You can access and retrieve meeting transcripts in a post-meeting scenario. Configure your app to get transcripts automatically for a scheduled meeting, and use them for insights, intelligent analysis, and more.

# Apps for Teams meetings

Meetings enable collaboration, partnership, informed communication, and shared feedback. The meeting app can deliver a user experience for each stage of the meeting lifecycle including pre-meeting, in-meeting, and post-meeting app experience, depending on the attendee's status.

The following list provides examples where users can access apps during meetings using the tab gallery from their calendar:

* Pre-stage a Kanban board.
* Launch an in-meeting actionable dialog.
* Create a post-meeting survey.

The following illustration gives you an idea of the meeting app extensibility features:

The document provides an overview of meeting app extensibility, [API references](API-references.md), enable and configure apps for meetings, and custom Together Mode scenes in Teams.

Enhance your meeting experience by using the [meeting app extensibility](meeting-app-extensibility.md) feature which enables you to integrate your apps within meetings. It also includes different stages of a meeting lifecycle, where you can integrate tabs, bots, and messaging extensions. You can identify various participant roles and user types, get meeting events, and generate in-meeting dialogs.

To customize Teams with apps for meetings, [enable your apps for Teams meetings by updating the app manifest and configure the apps for meeting scenarios](enable-and-configure-your-app-for-teams-meetings.md).

The new [custom Together Mode](teams-together-mode.md) scenes feature enables users to collaborate in a meeting with their team in one place.

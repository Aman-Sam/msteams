    The meeting side panel enhances your in-meeting experience and helps organizers and presenters to have different sets of views and actions.

    Key features of the meeting side panel are:

    * Provisions to add a new agenda point.
    * Adds the agenda as text input to the side panel list.
    * Publishes the agenda list to the meeting chat.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to generate meeting side panel to add and publish an agenda. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, call and all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> Install one of the following two workloads:<br> • ASP.NET and web development <br> • .NET Core cross-platform development | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the workloads. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK version 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. If you haven't installed the .NET 3.1 (or later) SDK globally, the portable version can be installed. |
     | &nbsp; | [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. Use the latest v16 LTS release.|
     | &nbsp; | [Latest version of Teams SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) | You can install the package using npm or yarn. |
     | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |

    To create and register your bot in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), perform the following steps:

    * Create Azure Bot resource to register bot with Azure Bot service.
    * Create client secret to enable single sign-on (SSO) authentication of the bot.
    * Add Teams channel to deploy the bot.
    * Create a ngrok tunnel to your web server's endpoints.
    * Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    **To create Azure bot resource**

    1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    1. Select **Create a resource**.
    1. In the search box, enter **Azure Bot**.

    Teams live share now enables users to discover more ways to collaborate and connect through teams. Users can now share content such as watch a movie, play live games etc. with each other in Teams One-on-one calls, group calls, schedule meetings, and meet now.
  
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create a Teams live share sample app. You'll see the following output:

- title: Prerequisites
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |
    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

 
    * [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/log-in) with a valid account
    * [Latest version of Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
    * [Latest version of nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    * [Latest version of ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) (only for devbox testing) or any equivalent tunneling solution
    
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    1. Select **Code**.
    1. From the dropdown menu, select **Open with GitHub Desktop**.

    After you have cloned the repo for Teams live share SDK, you can build and test the Teams live share tab in your local environment.

    In this page, you'll learn to:
    1. [Build and run your first tab](#build-and-run-the-sample)
    1. [Test your sample tab](#test-your-sample-tab-in-local-environment)


    ## Build and run the sample

    After the repository is cloned, you can build the sample tab.

    1. Open a terminal window.
    1. Run the change directory command in the terminal to change to the sample tab directory:

        ```bash
        cd live-share-sdk
        ```

    1. Install all dependencies using the following command:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

        You should see a bunch of dependencies getting installed.

    1. Run the following commands after installation is complete:

        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
    1. Select and run the sample tab directory command in the terminal:

        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
    1. Run the following start command  in the terminal:

        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

    When the Teams live share tab starts, it displays `dice rolling on the localhost port 8080` in the browser window.


    ## Test your sample tab in local environment

    Remember that apps in Microsoft Teams are web applications exposing one or more capabilities. Make your tab available on the internet so that the Teams platform can load it. To make your tab reachable from the internet, you need to *host* your tab.

    For local testing, you can run the tab on your local machine and create a tunnel to it with a web endpoint. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is a free tool that lets you do just that. With *ngrok*, you can get a web address such as `https://d0ac14a5.ngrok.io` (this URL is just an example). You can [download and install](https://ngrok.com/download) *ngrok* for your environment. Make sure you add it to a location in the `PATH`.

    ### Create ngrok tunnel

    After you install ngrok, you can create a tunnel to deploy your tab locally.

    1. Open a new ngrok terminal window.
    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample tab uses port 8080:

        ```bash
        ngrok http 8080 --host-header=localhost
        ```
        The ngrok tunnel is created. Here's an example of ngrok tunnel.

        (image to be added)

        *Ngrok* listens to requests from the internet and will route them to your tab running on port 8080.

     1. Navigate to **manifest.json** in cloned repository.
  
        (image to be added)

     1. Open **manifest.json** in Visual Studio and make the following changes:
       
        Replace `https://<<BASE_URI_DOMAIN>>` with your http endpoint from ngrok excluding the https:// part in all the places.

        (image to be added)
      
      1. Update the following in the manifest:

          * Set `developer.name` to your name.
          * Update `developer.websiteUrl` with your website.
          * Update `developer.privacyUrl` with your privacy policy.
          * Update `developer.termsOfUseUrl` with your terms of use.
      
      1. Zip the contents of the **Manifest** folder to create `manifest.zip`.
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > The `manifest.zip` should not contain any additional folders in it. It should have `manifest json` source file, `color` icon, and `outline` icon inside the zip folder.
        > Upload your manifest in your demo tenant for organization or your Teams account and run your solution in Visual Studio.
    
      1. Go to Teams.
      1. Schedule a meeting to test the tab from calendar in Teams.
      1. Join the meeting.
      1. In the meeting window, select **+ Apps** and select **Manage apps**.
      1. Select **Upload a custom app**.
      1. Upload the manifest.json.
      1. Select **Add** and the app is added to the meeting.
      1. Select **+ Apps** and select the app**.
      1. Select **Save**.
      1. Select Share to stage icon from the tab.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Live Share SDK is currently available only in [Public Developer Preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md). You must be part of the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams to use the Live Share SDK.

   Live Share SDK allows you to build collaborative apps and discover more ways to collaborate and connect through Teams. You can build apps to share content such as watching movies, playing live games, and so on, in Teams one-on-one calls, group calls, schedule meetings, and meet now.
  
   This step-by-step guide helps you to create a Agile Poker sample app using Live Share SDK. You'll see the following output:

- title: Build and run the Agile Poker sample app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    1. Go to the [Agile Poker](https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk/tree/main/samples/javascript/22.react-agile-poker) sample app.

    1. Clone the Live Share SDK repository to test the sample app:
       ```
         git clone https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk.git
    
       ```
    1. Open a terminal window.

    1. Run the following command to go to the Agile Poker sample app folder:

        ```
        cd live-share-sdk\samples\22.react-agile-poker
        ```
    1. Run the following command to install the dependency package:

        ```
        npm install
        ```
        
    1. Run the following command to start the client and the local server:

        ```
        npm run start
        ```

       A new browser tab opens a http://localhost:3000 window and the Agile Poker game appears.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-live-share/agile-poker-browser.png" alt-text="ngrok tunnel":::

    1. Open a new ngrok terminal window to create a tunnel and deploy your app locally.

    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample app uses port 3000:

        ```
        ngrok http 3000--host-header=localhost
        ```
        ngrok tunnel is created.

- title: Set up manifest file and upload your app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |
   You need to setup the manifest file and upload the manifest.zip package to Teams.

     1. Go to the **manifest.json** file in your sample app folder.
  
     1. Open **manifest.json** in Visual Studio Code and update the configuration URL.
       
        Replace `https://<<BASE_URI_DOMAIN>>` with your http endpoint from ngrok.

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-live-share/agile-poker-configuration-url.png" alt-text="update configuration url":::
      
     1. Zip the contents of the **manifest** folder to create `manifest.zip`.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Ensure that the `manifest.zip` contains only the `manifest.json` source file, `color` icon, and  the `outline` icon.

## Prepare Microsoft Teams for development

There are two possible ways to prepare a Microsoft Teams environment for building apps:

* Have your organization admin allow uploading apps in Teams
* Sign up for the Office Developer Program and get a new tenant

### Enabling uploading of apps

To upload apps that you develop, your organization administrator has to enable uploading in administrator settings. [Prepare your Office 365 tenant](~/get-started/get-started-tenant) describes the settings and how to change them.

### Office Developer Program

In case your organization administrator cannot change these settings, you can use a test tenant to upload your apps. The [Office 365 Developer Program](https://dev.office.com/devprogram) lets you create test tenants to load and test Office 365 and Teams apps. [Sign up](https://dev.office.com/devprogram) today to create your own tenant.
To configure your tenant for app development for Teams follow the steps in [Prepare your Office 365 tenant](~/get-started/get-started-tenant).

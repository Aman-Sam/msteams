The [Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/) developer platform makes it easy for you to extend Teams and integrate your own applications and services seamlessly into the Teams workspace. These apps can then be distributed to your enterprise or for teams around the world.

To extend Microsoft Teams, you will need to create a Microsoft Teams [app](~/concepts/apps/apps-overview). A Microsoft Teams app is a web application that you host. This app can then be integrated into the user's workspace in Teams.

Teams App Studio is a new tool that will help you to configure your application. It also contains a react control library and configurable samples for cards. It has not been integrated with this walkthrough yet, but is available for you to use.  See [Getting started with Teams App Studio](~/get-started/get-started-app-studio).

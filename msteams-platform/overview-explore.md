### Message extensions

Message extensions help search or start actions in an external web service and send the result of the interaction in Teams as a richly formatted card. Message extensions can be enhanced with AI capabilities with Copilot for Teams. For example, create and assign a bug in your tracking system based on a Teams message and send a card to the conversation thread with the bug's details.

### The user story

To understand how to use Teams apps to provide solutions for your users, consider the following scenario:

:::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a scenario of a notification bot that sends weather forecast to customers who want to plan for travel." lightbox="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario.png":::

You can pick the following features to build an app:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bot | Create a notification bot app to check and send weather forecast details based on user's travel date and travel location |
| Microsoft Graph | - Register users on the app <br>- Integrate the app with an external weather forecast API to connect and request forecast for specific date and location |

### Extend your Teams app across Microsoft 365

You can extend your Teams app across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem by configuring it to be accessible over Outlook and Microsoft 365.

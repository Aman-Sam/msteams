# Explore Teams app capabilities

With Teams, you can build your app in a feature-rich environment. Using Teams as a platform for building apps, you can extend the Teams features as capabilities for your desktop and mobile apps.

## Teams app capabilities

Teams platform provides the following capabilities to build your app:

### Message extensions

Interact with your web service from Teams through message extensions. Search or start actions in an external system and send the result of the interaction in Teams as a richly formatted card. Message extensions can be enhanced with AI capabilities with Copilot for Teams. For example, create a bug in your tracking system based on a Teams message, assign that bug to a user, and send a card to the conversation thread with the bug's details.

### Tabs

Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. You can add tabs as part of a channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user. Tabs can be used in personal chats, channels, or groups, and for Stage View and unfurling links.

### Bots

Also referred to as a chatbot or conversational bot, bots automate simple and repetitive tasks. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation that provides access to services. Use bots in apps for customer service, make dinner reservations, or provide travel information.

### The user story

To understand how to use Teams apps to provide solutions for your users, consider the following scenario:

:::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a scenario of a notification bot that sends weather forecast to customers who want to plan for travel." lightbox="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario.png":::

You can pick the following features to build an app:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bot | Create a notification bot app to check and send weather forecast details based on user's travel date and travel location |
| Microsoft Graph | - Register users on the app <br>- Integrate the app with an external weather forecast API to connect and request forecast for specific date and location |

### Extend your Teams app across Microsoft 365

You can extend your Teams app across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem by configuring it to be accessible over Outlook and Microsoft 365.

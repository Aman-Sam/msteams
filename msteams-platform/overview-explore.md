## Teams app features

| Feature | Description | Useful for |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Tabs | Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. You can add them as part of a channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user. | Personal tab, channel or group tab, stage view, and link unfurling. |
| Bots | A bot is also referred to as a chatbot or conversational bot. It's an app that runs simple and repetitive automated tasks done by the users. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation that provides access to services. | Customer service, information about the weather, make dinner reservations, or provide travel information. |
| Message extension | Message extensions let the users interact with your web service Teams client. They search or start actions in an external system. You can send the result of the interaction to the Teams client as a richly formatted card. | Reserve a resource and allow the channel to know the reserved time slot. Search for a work item, and share it with the group as an Adaptive Card. Create a bug in your tracking system based on a Teams message, assign that bug to a user, and send a card to the conversation thread with the bug's details. |
|Meeting extensions | You can create apps to make meetings more productive. | Ask people to complete a survey during a call or send a quick reminder that doesnâ€™t interrupt the flow of the meeting. |
| Personal app | A personal app is a dedicated space (tab) or bot to help users focus on their own tasks or view activities important to them. | OneNote is a personal app that gives you a private workspace within Teams. Planner offers a bird's eye view of all your tasks, across boards that you or your team have added as channel tabs. |
| Webhooks and connectors | Communicate with external apps, and send or receive notifications and messages from other apps. | Subscribe to receive notifications and messages from your web services. |
| Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365 and can be incorporated in any kind of Teams app. | Create, manage, find, and archive large number of teams and populate them with users and channels. |
| Adaptive Card | Cards help you organize information into groups and give users the opportunity to interact with specific parts of the information. | Sharing using text and images; gathering information using input forms. |
| Task modules | Task modules permit you to create modal pop-up experiences in your Teams application. | Run your own custom HTML or JavaScript code. Show an <`iframe`>-based widget such as a YouTube or Microsoft Stream video. |

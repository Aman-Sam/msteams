# Build Bot based Message extension

A bot based message extension requires a ChatGPT plugin manifest, which needs to be hosted on the APIâ€™s domain.

Before you build a bot based message extension, ensure that you have the following:

* An API document in the OpenAPI yaml or JSON format.
* A JSON manifest file that defines the relevant metadata such as name, logo, and OpenAPI spec for the endpoints for the plugin and host the file in a domain.

    Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C#, instead of JavaScript. 
    
    You can create a tab app and a bot app with Blazor and the latest version of Visual Studio.

    Here's a list of tools you require for building and deploying your app.

    | &nbsp;    | Install   | For using... |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio version 17.2.0 preview 2.1](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=enterprise&ch=pre&rel=17)|  Select Visual Studio Enterprise 2022 Preview (version 17.2.0 preview 2.1). |
    | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, call - all in one place. |
    | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |
    

    ## Prepare development environment

    After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.

    ### Install Microsoft Teams Toolkit

    The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio, or as a CLI (called `teamsfx`). 
    
    # [Latest version of the Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

    You can use the latest version of the Visual Studio to develop Teams apps with Blazor Server in .NET.

    To install the Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension:

    1. Download the latest version of the Visual Studio.
    1. Open `vs_enterprise__3bed52501a604464b1eff2ce580fd4eb.exe` from your download folder.
    1. Select **Continue** in the **Visual Studio Installer** page to configure your installation.

       :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/blazor/visual-studio-installer.png" alt-text="Select continue to configure your installation":::  

    1. Select **ASP.NET and web development** under workloads.

    1. Select **Microsoft Teams development tools**.
       
    1. Select **Install**.

       :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/blazor-vs-preview2/vs.install.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to install Microsoft development tool.":::  
       
     Your Visual Studio is installed in a few minutes.
    
    # [Command line](#tab/cli)

    To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

    ``` bash
    npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```

    Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

    ``` bash
    sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```

    This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

    Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

    You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the "remote signed" execution policy for PowerShell.

    ---

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

    ### Enable sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.
      
    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If Teams doesn't show the option to upload a custom app, connect to your Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it for free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
    1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.png" alt-text="Example of what you see after signing up for the Microsoft 365 developer program.":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

    ## Get a free Azure account

    If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

    Now you've got all tools and set up your accounts. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

    1.  Use ngrok or Command prompt to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

        ```bash
        ngrok http --host-header=localhost 2544
        ```

     1. Select **Debug** > **Start Debugging** or select **F5** to run your app in debug mode.

        When you select **F5**, Teams Toolkit:

        1. Registers your application with Azure Active Directory.
        1. Registers your application for "sideloading" in Teams.
        1. Starts your application backend running locally.
        1. Starts your application front-end hosted locally.
        1. Starts Teams in a web browser with a command to instruct Teams to side load the application (the URL is registered inside the application manifest).
    
        </details>
        
        >[!NOTE]
        > When you run the app for the first time, all dependencies are downloaded, and the app is built. A browser window automatically opens when the build is complete. This process can take 3-5 minutes to complete.

        Your web browser starts to run the app.

    1. Select **Add** when prompted to sideload the app onto Teams on your local machine.

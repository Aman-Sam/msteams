    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment:
 
    * [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/log-in) with a valid account
    * [Latest version of Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * [Latest version of nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    * [Latest version of ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) or equivalent tunneling solution
      
      > [!NOTE]
      > If you're downloading ngrok for the first time, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    1. Go to the [app caching](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/v-mfurquan/app-cache-meetings-nodejs/samples/app-cache-meetings/nodejs) sample app.

    1. Clone the Live Share SDK repository to test the sample app:
       ```
         git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    
       ```
    1. Open a terminal window in Visual Studio Code.

    1. Run the following command to go to the app cache sample app folder:

        ```
        cd live-share-sdk\samples\app-cache-meetings\nodejs
        ```
    1. Run the following command to install the dependency package:

        ```
        npm install
        ```
        
    1. Run the following command to start the client and the local server:

        ```
        npm start
        ```

       A new browser tab opens a http://localhost:3978 window.

    1. Open a new ngrok terminal window to create a tunnel and deploy your app locally.

    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample app uses port 3978:

        ```
        ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
        ```
        ngrok tunnel is created.

- title: Set up manifest file and upload your app
  durationInMinutes: 1

   You need to setup the manifest file and upload the manifest.zip package to Teams.

     1. Go to the **manifest.json** file in your app package.
  
     1. Open **manifest.json** in Visual Studio Code.
     
     1. Replace `id` with GUID, use [app caching](https://guidgenerator.com/) to generate GUID.
       
     1. Replace `<<Valid_Domain>>` with your http endpoint from ngrok.
      
     1. Zip the contents of the **manifest** folder to create `manifest.zip`.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Ensure that the `manifest.zip` contains only the `manifest.json` source file, `color` icon, and  the `outline` icon.

# Teams Domain Migration

Microsoftâ€™s cloud services that Teams apps use are hosted on multiple domains and this fragmentation creates challenges for end user navigation, administrative simplicity, and the development of cross-app experiences. Hence, Microsoft is consolidating new and existing domains to the new *cloud.microsoft* domain, which includes the current Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 domains. Hence, you need to configure your Teams app to run on these new domains.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you don't configure your Teams app to run on the new domains by June 1, 2024, your app will lose critical functionality.

## Benefits of consolidated domain

Consolidating user-facing Microsoft experiences onto a single domain benefits stakeholders in several ways.

* For you, it provides better integration across Microsoft apps by streamlining development and improving performance of cross-app experiences.
* For end users, it reduces sign-in prompts, redirects, and delays when navigating Teams apps.
* For admins, it simplifies managing permissions of end users without compromising the security of your tenant.

## New consolidated domains

| **Existing Domain** | **New Domain** | **App Type** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| *teams.microsoft.com* | *teams.cloud.microsoft* | Teams app |
| *outlook.microsoft.com* | *outlook.cloud.microsoft* | Teams app extended across Outlook and Microsoft 365 |
| *m365.microsoft.com* | *m365.cloud.microsoft* | Teams app extended across Outlook and Microsoft 365 |

## How to avoid breaking app functionality

The following steps need to be performed in order to ensure your Teams app doesn't lose critical functionality:

1. Upgrade TeamsJS SDK to version 2.19.0 or higher. For more information, see [Teams JavaScript client library](../tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-library.md).

2. Update your `x-frame-options` and Content Security Policy headers in your Teams app to allow your app to access the following new domains:
    1. *teams.cloud.microsoft*

3. If your Teams app extends across Outlook and Microsoft 365, along with the *teams.cloud.microsoft* domain, ensure you allow the following new domains:
    1. *outlook.cloud.microsoft*
    2. *m365.cloud.microsoft*

> [!NOTE]
> * From TeamsJS SDK 2.19.0 onwards, the list of trusted domains is migrated to a new content delivery network (CDN) endpoint that would be called upon app initialization.
> * This list is dynamic and doesn't require you to update the SDK for any future changes to the list.
> * The new CDN endpoint ensures that your Teams app extended across Outlook and Microsoft 365 is always enabled to run with full functionality.

# Extend Teams apps across Microsoft 365

> [!NOTE]
> Teams developers can try the new functionalities and [provide feedback](/microsoftteams/platform/feedback) using existing applications, in early Developer preview for expansion of the Teams developer platform into other high-usage areas of the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

You can test your Teams apps running in Microsoft Office and Outlook by updating your code to use the new [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK v2 Preview](using-teams-client-sdk-preview.md) and Microsoft Teams [Developer preview manifest](../resources/schema/manifest-schema-dev-preview.md).

With this preview, you can:

- Extend existing Teams [personal tabs](/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/create-personal-tab) to Outlook for desktop and on the web, and also Microsoft Office Home (office.com).
- Extend existing Teams [search-based messaging extensions](/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command) to Outlook for desktop and on the web.

For feedback and issues, use [Microsoft Teams developer community channels](/microsoftteams/platform/feedback).

## Teams personal tabs in Office and Outlook

Personal tabs can provide users, access to their application right within the Teams, without sign in and sign out. You can create a customized tab and pin it to the left pane for easy access in Outlook on Windows desktop and the web, and also Microsoft Office Home (office.com).

## Teams messaging extensions in Outlook

Messaging extension search commands allow users to search external systems and share the results through compose message of Outlook on web and Windows desktop, and Teams.

After sideloading to Teams, your messaging extension appears as one of your installed apps within the Outlook compose message area.

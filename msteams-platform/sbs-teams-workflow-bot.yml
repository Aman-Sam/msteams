    The Adaptive Card action handler feature enables the app to respond to adaptive card actions triggered by you to complete a sequential workflow.
    When you get an Adaptive Card, it can provide one or more buttons in the card to ask for your input. You can do something like calling some APIs, and then send another adaptive card in your conversation in response to the card action.

    In this tutorial, you'll learn:

      * How to build workflow bot with Teams Toolkit.
      * About the directory structure of your app.
      * Customize installation of your bot with the Adaptive card response.
    This step-by-step guide helps you to build workflow bot with Teams Toolkit. You can see the following output:

    > [!NOTE]
    > The guide is tested on Teams Toolkit version 4.0.0 and Nodejs version 14 and 16. The steps in this guide may work with other versions, but that hasn't been tested.
    
    ## Prepare development environment
    After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.
    
    ### Install the Teams Toolkit
    The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    
    You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code or CLI (command-line interface) called `TeamsFx`.
    
    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)
    
    1. Open Visual Studio Code and select **Extensions** (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
    1. In the search box, enter **Teams Toolkit**.
    1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.
       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/teams-toolkit.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit extension installation.":::
    
    The Teams Toolkit icon appears in the Visual Studio Code sidebar after it's installed.
    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/hw-teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code sidebar.":::
    
    You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).
    
    # [Command line](#tab/cli)
    To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:
    ``` bash
    npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```
    Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:
    ``` bash
    sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```
    It's more common on Linux and macOS systems.
    Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  
    You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Before you run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, ensure you enable the **remote signed** execution policy for PowerShell.
    
    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container where you chat, share files, and run meetings for your organization in Teams. You can also sideload and test your app.
    ### Check for sideloading option
    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This is known as sideloading. Sign-in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. Enable Sideloading to preview and test your app in Teams locally.
    
    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!
    To verify sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** .
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Publish an app**.

    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > Contact Teams administrator, if you don't have the option to upload a custom app.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. Select **Set up E5 subscription** from the welcome screen.
    1. Set up administrator account. After you finish, the following screen displays.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Microsoft":::

    1. Sign-in to Teams using the new administrator account. Now you should have the **Upload a custom app** option.

    You can interact with the bot in Teams by sending it a message, or selecting a command from the command list. The bot responds to the following strings:

    In the left pane of the Teams, select the ellipses ●●●, and then select your app from the list. The bot shows **Suggestions** as follows:

    :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/conversation-bot/suggestions.png" alt-text="Suggestions card.":::

    | MentionMe    | Show Welcome   | MessageAllMembers |
    | --- | --- | --- |

    | **Result:** The bot responds to the message and mention the user. | **Result:** The bot sends the welcome card for you to interact with. |  **Result:** The bot sends a one-on-one message to each member in the current conversation. |
    | **Valid scopes:** personal, group chat, team chat. | **Valid scopes:** personal, group chat, team chat. |  **Valid scopes:** personal, group chat, team chat. |

    You can select an option from the command list by typing **@TeamsConversationBot** into the compose message area and **What can I do?** text above the compose area.

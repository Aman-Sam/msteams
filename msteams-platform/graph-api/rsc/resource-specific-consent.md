# Resource-specific consent

> [!NOTE]
> Resource-specific consent for chat scope is available in [public developer preview](../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md) only.

Resource-specific consent (RSC) is an authorization framework built by Microsoft Teams and Microsoft identity that allows for granting scoped access to an application.

Through RSC, an authorized user can give an application access to the data of only a specific instance of a resource type instead of giving broad access to every instance of a resource type in the entire tenant. For example, a person who owns both team A and team B can decide to give the data for the Contoso app to only team A and not team B. The same concept of scoped data access applies to chats and meetings.

> [!NOTE]
> If a chat has a meeting or a call associated with it, then the relevant RSC permissions apply to those resources as well.

## Types of RSC permissions

RSC permission determines which data access methods are allowed by an application. There are two types of RSC permissions:

* **Application**: Allows an app to access data without a signed-in user. For more information on application permissions, see [Resource Specific Consent for MS Graph and MS BotSDK](../../graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent.md).
* **Delegated**: Allows an app to access data only on behalf of a signed-in user. No access is allowed in the absence of a signed-in user.

### RSC permissions for different resources

RSC permissions are available on the following different resource types:

* [Team](#rsc-permissions-for-a-team) (includes the channels within a team)
* [Chat or meeting](#rsc-permissions-for-a-chat-or-meeting) (includes the meetings associated with the chats)
* [User](#rsc-permissions-for-a-user)

### API that supports RSC-based data access

Microsoft Graph SDK, Microsoft Bot Framework SDK, and Microsoft Teams Client SDK support fine-grained data access through RSC. The supported modes and resource types differ across the API surfaces.

| RSC mode or type | Supported SDKs | App manifest version | Resource types | RSC-related controls for the entire tenant | Who can consent to RSC permissions? |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Application| Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Bot Framework | >=1.6 | Teams, chats, and meetings | Microsoft Graph-based controls for chats and meetings, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) portal-based controls for teams. |• In a team, any team owner. <br> • In a chat, any chat member. <br> • In a meeting, any meeting organizer or presenter. |
| Delegated | Microsoft Teams Client | >=1.12 | Teams, chats, meetings, and users | Always on | Any user authorized to install an app in that specific scope. |

## Update your Teams app manifest

The RSC permissions are declared in your app's manifest.json file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Non-RSC permissions are stored in the Azure portal. Don't add them to the app manifest.

### Request RSC permissions for Teams app

To request RSC permissions for an app, list the permissions that the app requires in the authorization section of the Teams app's manifest. The instructions can differ based on the manifest version of the app.

> [!NOTE]
> For delegated permissions, use app manifest version 1.12 or later.

Add a [webApplicationInfo](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#webapplicationinfo) key to your app manifest with the following values:

|Name| Type | Description|
|---|---|---|
|`id` |String |Your Azure AD app ID. For more information, see [register your app in the Azure AD portal](resource-specific-consent.md#register-your-app-with-microsoft-identity-platform-using-the-azure-ad-portal).|
|`resource`|String| This field has no operation in RSC but must be added and must have a value to avoid an error response; any string will do.|

Specify permissions needed by the app.

|Name| Type | Description|
|---|---|---|
|`authorization`|Object|List of permissions that the app needs to function. For more information, see [authorization in manifest](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#authorization).

</details>

Whenever an app is installed by an authorized user within Teams, the RSC permissions requested in the app’s manifest are shown to the user and consequently granted as part of the app installation process.

## Grant RSC permissions to an app

Apart from the tenant admin, who can grant any type of permission to any app, users' ability to grant RSC permissions varies based on resource types and access modes. The following are the types of RSC permissions for an app:

* **Application context RSC permissions**: Users authorized to install an app in a specific scope have the right to grant any RSC permissions requested by the app in that specific scope. In addition to installing apps in a specific scope, the following constraints apply for the user to grant RSC permission to access data in app-only mode:
  * In the case of a team, the user must be an owner of that team.
  * In the case of a chat, the user must be a member of the chat.
  * In the case of meetings, the user must be an organizer or presenter in the meeting.
* **Delegated context RSC permissions**: Any user authorized to install an app in a specific scope has the right to grant any RSC permissions requested by the app in that specific scope. For example, if regular members are allowed to install an app inside a team, then they also have the authority to grant delegated RSC permission to the app in that specific team.

If you're a global admin, you can review, and grant consent to apps that request permissions on behalf of all users in your organization. You do this so that users don't have to review and accept the permissions requested by the app when they start the app. For more information, see [view app permissions and grant admin consent in Teams admin center](/microsoftteams/app-permissions-admin-center).

## Enable RSC in your application

1. [Configure consent settings](#configure-consent-settings).
    1. Configure group owner consent settings for RSC in a team using the Azure AD portal.
    1. Configure chat owner consent settings for RSC in a chat using the Microsoft Graph APIs.
1. [Register your app with Microsoft identity platform using the Azure AD portal](#register-your-app-with-microsoft-identity-platform-using-the-azure-ad-portal).
1. [Review your application permissions in the Azure AD portal](#review-your-application-permissions-in-the-azure-ad-portal).
1. [Obtain an access token from the identity platform](#obtain-an-access-token-from-the-microsoft-identity-platform).
1. [Update your Teams app manifest](#update-your-teams-app-manifest).
1. [Install your app directly in Teams](#sideload-your-app-in-teams).
1. [Check your app for added RSC permissions](#check-your-app-for-added-rsc-permissions).
    1. Check your app for added RSC permissions in a team.
    1. Check your app for added RSC permissions in a chat.

## Configure consent settings

For application permissions, admins have a toggle to enable or disable RSC permissions for all apps for the entire tenant. The tenant-level controls of app-only RSC permissions differ based on resource type.

For delegated permissions, any authorized user can consent to the permissions requested by the app.

<br>

<details>

<summary><b>Configure group owner consent settings for RSC in a team using the Azure AD portal</b></summary>

You can enable or disable [group owner consent](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent-groups?tabs=azure-portal) directly within the Microsoft Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a [Global Administrator or Company Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator&preserve-view=true).
1. Select **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise applications** > **Consent and permissions** > [**User consent settings**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConsentPoliciesMenuBlade/UserSettings).
1. Enable, disable, or limit user consent with the control labeled **Group owner consent for apps accessing data**. The default is **Allow group owner consent for all group owners**. For a team owner to install an app using RSC, group owner consent must be enabled for that user.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/azure-rsc-team-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Azure RSC team configuration.":::

In addition, you can enable or disable group owner consent using PowerShell, follow the steps outlined in [configure group owner consent using PowerShell](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent-groups?tabs=azure-powershell).

<br>

</details>

<br>

<details>

<summary><b>Configure chat owner consent settings for RSC in a chat using the Microsoft Graph APIs</b></summary>

You can enable or disable RSC for chats using Graph API. The property `isChatResourceSpecificConsentEnabled` in [**teamsAppSettings**](/graph/api/teamsappsettings-update#example-1-enable-installation-of-apps-that-require-resource-specific-consent-in-chats-meetings) governs whether chat RSC is enabled in the tenant.
    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/rsc/graph-rsc-chat-configuration.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Graph RSC team configuration.":::

The default value of the property `isChatResourceSpecificConsentEnabled` is based on whether [user consent settings](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent?tabs=azure-portal) is turned on or off in the tenant when RSC for chats is first used. This can be the first time retrieving [teamsAppSettings](/graph/api/teamsappsettings-get) or installing a Teams app with resource-specific permissions in a chat or meeting.

> [!NOTE]
> Admin control will be added to allow or block RSC consent settings per app based on the sensitivity of the data being accessed instead of the current single master switch that enables or disables consent settings for app-only RSC permissions for all apps in the tenant.

<br>

</details>

## List of RSC permissions granted to a specific resource

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The RSC permissions are not attributed to a user. Calls are made with app permissions, not user delegated permissions. The app can be allowed to perform actions that the user cannot, such as deleting a tab. You must review the team owner's or chat owner's intent for your use before making RSC API calls. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams API overview](/graph/teams-concept-overview).

Call the following APIs to retrieve the list of apps installed in a team or chat:

* [List apps in chat](/graph/api/chat-list-installedapps?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true)
* [List apps in team](/graph/api/team-list-installedapps?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true)

For delegated RSC permissions, call the APIs to list all the apps that are installed in a chat or team. However, you can't know the permissions that are granted because they are granted when an app is running without user interaction.

For application RSC permissions, call the APIs to list the permissions granted in a chat or team. These are all the application RSC permissions granted on this specific resource. Each entry in the list can be correlated to a TeamsApp by matching the `clientAppId` in the permission grants list with the `webApplicationInfo.Id` property in the TeamsApp’s manifest.

After the app has been installed to a resource, you can use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) to view the permissions that have been granted to the app in the resource.

## Register your app with Microsoft identity platform using the Azure AD portal

The Azure AD portal provides a central platform for you to register and configure your apps. Your app must be registered in the Azure AD portal to integrate with the identity platform and call Microsoft Graph APIs. For more information, see [register an application with the identity platform](/graph/auth-register-app-v2).

> [!WARNING]
> An Azure AD app ID must not be shared across multiple Teams apps. There must be a 1:1 mapping between a Teams app and an Azure AD app. Attempts to install multiple Teams apps which are associated with the same Azure AD app ID will cause installation or runtime failures.

## Review your application permissions in the Azure AD portal

1. Go to the **Home** > **App registrations** page and select your RSC app.
1. Choose **API permissions** from the left pane and go through the list of **Configured permissions** for your app. If your app only makes RSC Graph API calls, delete all the permissions on that page. If your app also makes non-RSC calls, keep those permissions as required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure AD portal cannot be used to request RSC permissions. RSC permissions are currently exclusive to Teams applications installed in the Teams client and are declared in the Teams app manifest (JSON) file.

## Obtain an access token from the Microsoft identity platform

To make Graph API calls, you must obtain an access token for your app from the identity platform. Before your app can get a token from the identity platform, it must be registered in the Azure AD portal. The access token contains information about your app and the permissions it has for the resources and APIs available through Microsoft Graph.

You must have the following values from the Azure AD registration process to retrieve an access token from the identity platform:

* The **Application ID** assigned by the app registration portal. If your app supports single sign-on (SSO) you must use the same Application ID for your app and SSO.
* The **Client secret/password** or a public or private key pair that is **Certificate**. This isn't required for native apps.
* A **Redirect URI** or reply URL for your app to receive responses from Azure AD.

For more information, see [get access on behalf of a user](/graph/auth-v2-user?view=graph-rest-1.0#3-get-a-token&preserve-view=true) and [get access without a user](/graph/auth-v2-service).

## Sideload your app in Teams

If your Teams admin allows custom app uploads, you can [sideload your app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload.md) directly to a specific team or chat.

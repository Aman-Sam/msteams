# Send activity feed notifications to users in Microsoft Teams

The Microsoft Teams activity feed enables users to triage items that require attention by notifying them of changes. You can use the activity feed notification APIs in Microsoft Graph to extend this functionality to your apps. This allows your apps to provide richer experiences and better engage users by helping to keep them up to date with changes in the tools and workflows they use.

## Understand the basics of activity feed notification

Activity feed notifications in Microsoft Teams are comprised of multiple bits of information, displayed together, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/activity-feed/notification-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the components of an activity feed notification.":::

The components include:

|Counter|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|1|**Avatar**: Shows who initiated the activity.|
|2|**Activity type/app icon**: Depicts the type of activity. For app notifications, the line icon is replaced with an app icon.|
|3|**Title (first line): Actor + reason**: *Actor*: Name of the user or app that initiated the activity. *Reason*: Describes the activity.|
|4|**Timestamp**: Shows when the activity happened.|
|5|**Text preview (third line) (second line)**: Shows a truncated line from the start of the notification.|
|6|**Location**: Shows where the activity happened in Teams.|

The following example shows the components together provide the details about a notification.

### Types of activity feed notification cards

The following variants show the kinds of activity feed notification cards you can display. The app logo replaces the user avatar for app-generated notifications.

## Requirements for using the activity feed notification APIs

Activity feed APIs work with a [Teams app](/microsoftteams/platform/overview). The following are the requirements for sending activity feed notifications:

- The Teams app manifest must have the Azure AD app ID added to the `webApplicationInfo` section. For details, see [manifest schema](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema).
- Activity types must be declared in the `activities` section. For details, see [manifest schema](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema).
- The Teams app must be installed for the recipient, either personally, or in a [team](/graph/api/resources/team) or [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat) they are part of. For more information, see [Teams app installation](/graph/api/resources/teamsappinstallation).

### Teams app manifest changes

This section describes the changes that need to be added to Teams app manifest. Note that you must be using the [Teams app manifest](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) version `1.7` or greater.

```json
"$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.7/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
"manifestVersion": "1.7",
```

#### webApplicationInfo section changes

```json
"webApplicationInfo":
{
    "id": "a3111f15-658e-457c-9689-fd20fe907330",
    "resource": "https://contosoapp.com"
}
```

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|string|Azure AD app ID (client ID).|
|resource|string|Resource associated with the Azure AD app. Also known as reply or redirect URL in the Azure Portal.|

> [!NOTE]
> You might get an error if multiple Teams apps in the same scope (team, chat or user) are using the same Azure AD app. Make sure that you're using unique Azure AD apps.

#### activities section changes

```json
"activities":
{
  "activityTypes": [
    {
      "type": "taskCreated",
      "description": "Task Created Activity",
      "templateText": "{actor} created task {taskId} for you"
    },
    {
      "type": "approvalRequired",
      "description": "Deployment requires your approval",
      "templateText": "{actor} created a new deployment {deploymentId}"
    }
  ]
}
```

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|type|string|Type of activity. This needs to be unique in a specific manifest.|
|description|string|Human-readable short description. This will be visible on the Microsoft Teams client.|
|templateText|string|Template text for the activity notification. You can declare your parameters by encapsulating parameters in `{}`.|

> [!NOTE]
> `actor` is a special parameter that always takes the name of the caller. In delegated calls, `actor` is the user's name. In application-only calls, it takes the name of the Teams app.

### Install the Teams app

Teams apps can be installed in a team, a chat, or for a user personally, and can be distributed in multiple ways. For details, see [Teams app distribution methods](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/overview). Typically, [sideloading](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload) is preferred for development purposes. After development, you can choose the right distribution method based on whether you want to distribute to one tenant or to all tenants.

You can also use [Teams app installation](/graph/api/resources/teamsappinstallation) APIs to manage Teams app installations.

## Send activity feed notifications to users

Because a Teams app can be installed for a user, in a team, or in a chat, the notifications can be sent in these three contexts as well:

- [Send notification to user in a chat](/graph/api/chat-sendactivitynotification)
- [Send notification to user in a team](/graph/api/team-sendactivitynotification)
- [Send notification to user](/graph/api/userteamwork-sendactivitynotification)

Additionally, notifications can be sent in bulk up to 100 users at a time:

- [Send notifications to multiple users in bulk](/graph/api/teamwork-sendactivitynotificationtorecipients)

For details about what topics are supported for each scenario, see the specific APIs. Custom text-based topics are supported for all scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> The activity icon is based on the context the request is made in. If the request is made with delegated permissions, the user's photo appears as the avatar, while the Teams app icon appears as the activity icon. In an application-only context, the Teams app icon is used as the avatar and the activity icon is omitted.

### Scenarios based on first party apps

|Scenarios|Description|
|:---|:---|
|**News**|New assigment, task, or post this kind of news help user to stay with the latest update.|
|**Collaboration**|Shared a file, mentioned you in comment so, this helps to understand where the coworker requires a collobaration. Activity notification grabs the attention in teams as we a pop up and see who is requesting in the text preview.|
|**Reminder**|A backlog, but not doing it yet and its due or focus time is coming up. For example, a training is coming up nearing the due date and this type of reminder notification helps to interact user form other tasks. |
|**Alert**|It's like urgent that requires attention immedaitely. For example, a traing passed due to complete or admin send a request to fix a bugor change some configuration fast.|

### Scenario-based adoption strategy

|Notifications|App Capability|&nbsp;|Notification requirement|
|---|---|---|---|
|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|Pros|Cons|
|Activity notifications|Tab app |Feed <br> Personal Notification <br> Localization <br> Batch send|App must be installed for the user.<br> No one-click response/action. <br> May need admin consent in some cases.|
|Bot notifications|Bot app|Adaptive cards <br> Notification sent from bot <br> Quick response <br> Media|Notification can be turned of from chat or channel.<br>App must be installed in the scope (chat or channel).<br>Need to set up appâ€™s own storage for prod environment.|

### Use Activity notification and Bot notification

## Customize the notifications alerts / Manage activity feed notifications

Microsoft Teams users can customize the notifications they see in their feed, as a banner, and so on. Notifications generated through activity feed APIs can also be customized. Users can choose how they are notified via settings in Microsoft Teams. Teams apps will appear in the list for the user to choose from, as shown in the following screenshot.

    The workflow bot allows users to interact with an Adaptive Card enabled by the Adaptive Card action handler feature in the workflow bot app. When you respond to the triggered Adaptive Card action, then a sequential workflow is completed.
    When you get an Adaptive Card, it provides one or more buttons in the card for your input. You can also call an API, and then send another Adaptive Card in your conversation in response to the card action.
    In this tutorial, you'll learn:
      * How to build workflow bot with Teams Toolkit.
      * About the directory structure of your app.
      * Customize installation of your bot with the Adaptive Card response.
    
    You can see the following output:

    > The guide is tested on Teams Toolkit version 5.0.0 and Nodejs version 14 and 16. The steps in this guide may work with other versions, but that hasn't been tested.
    
    ## Prepare development environment
    After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.
    
    ### Install the Teams Toolkit
    The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    
    You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code or CLI (command-line interface) called `TeamsFx`.
    
    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)
    
    1. Open Visual Studio Code and select **Extensions** (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
    1. In the search box, enter **Teams toolkit**.
    1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

    The Teams Toolkit :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/hw-teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code side bar."::: icon appears in the Visual Studio Code **Activity Bar** after it's installed.
        
    You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The latest version of Teams Toolkit is 5.0.0.

    # [Command line](#tab/cli)
    To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:
    ``` bash
    npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```
    Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:
    ``` bash
    sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```
    It's more common on Linux and macOS systems.
    Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  
    You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Before you run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, ensure you enable the **remote signed** execution policy for PowerShell.
    
    ## Set up your Teams development tenant
    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container where you chat, share files, and run meetings for your organization in Teams. You can also sideload and test your app.
    ### Check for sideloading option
    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This is known as sideloading. Sign-in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. Enable Sideloading to preview and test your app in Teams locally.
    
    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!
    To verify sideload apps in Teams:
    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** .
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Publish an app**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.
        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::
        > [!NOTE]
        > Contact Teams administrator, if you don't have the option to upload a custom app.
    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)
    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!
    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. Select **Setup E5 subscription** from the welcome screen.
    1. Set up administrator account. After you finish, the following screen displays.
       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Microsoft":::
    1. Sign-in to Teams using the new administrator account. Now you should have the **Upload a custom app** option.

    ### Take tour of source code
    Teams Toolkit provides components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code for JavaScript/TypeScript. 
    
    :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/sbs-workflow-bot-scaffolding2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the selction to add your workflow bot app.":::
    
    
    The created bot is a normal TeamsFx project that contains following folders:
    
    | Folder / File | Contents |
    | - | - |
    | `teamsapp.yml` | Main project file describes your application configuration and defines the set of actions to run in each lifecycle stages. |
    | `teamsapp.local.yml`| This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging. |
    | `env/`| Name / value pairs are stored in environment files and used by `teamsapp.yml` to customize the provisioning and deployment rules. |
    | `.vscode/` | VSCode files for debugging. |
    | `appPackage/` | Templates for the Teams application manifest. |
    | `infra/` | Templates for provisioning Azure resources. |
    | `src/` | The source code for the application. |
    | `src/index.js`| Application entry point and `restify` handlers for the Workflow bot. |
    | `src/teamsBot.js` | An empty teams activity handler for bot customization. |
    | `src/commands/helloworldCommandHandler.js` | Implementation that handles responding to a chat command. |
    | `src/adaptiveCards/helloworldCommandResponse.json` | Defines the Adaptive Card (UI) that is displayed in response to a chat command. |
    | `src/adaptiveCards/doStuffActionResponse.json` | A generated Adaptive Card that is sent to Teams for the response of "doStuff" action. |
    | `src/cardActions/doStuffActionHandler.js` | Implements the handler for the `doStuff` button displayed in the Adaptive Card. |

# Build a Teams messaging extension

There are two types of Teams *messaging extensions*: Search commands and action commands.

In this lesson, you'll create a *search command* (also known as a *search-based messaging extension*), which is a shortcut for finding external content and sharing it in Teams. Users can access search commands from the [Teams compose or command box](../messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions.md).

## Your assignment

Your organization's help desk communicates with users through Teams, but the tickets reside in a separate system. This means support staff must constantly go back and forth between apps. You'll investigate how you might reduce this much context switching by creating a simple search-based messaging extension for Teams.

## What you'll learn

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create an app project and messaging extension bot using the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code
> * Identify the app manifest properties and some of the scaffolding relevant to messaging extensions
> * Host an app locally
> * Configure the bot for your messaging extension
> * Sideload and test a messaging extension in Teams

## Before you begin

If you haven't yet, make sure you [understand and install the Teams development prerequisites](build-first-app-overview.md#get-prerequisites).

## Create your app project

The Microsoft Teams Toolkit helps you set up the following components for your messaging extension:

* **App manifest and scaffolding** relevant to messaging extensions
* **Bot** for your messaging extension that's automatically registered with the Microsoft Azure Bot Service

> [!TIP]
> If you haven't created a Teams app project before, you might find it helpful to follow [these instructions](../build-your-first-app/build-and-run.md) that explain projects in more detail.

1. In Visual Studio Code, select **Microsoft Teams** :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/vsc-toolkit.png"::: on the left Activity Bar and choose **Create a new Teams app**.
1. Enter a name for your Teams app. (This is the default name for your app and also the name of the app project directory on your local machine.)
1. On the **Add capabilities** screen, select **Messaging Extension** then **Next**.
1. On the **Configure messaging extension** screen, do the following:
    1. Choose only the **Search-based** option for the type of messaging extension.
    1. Select **Create a new Bot** and **Login** to sign in with your Microsoft 365 development account.
    1. Store your bot ID and password (you need this a little later).
    1. (Optional) Enter a custom name for your bot and select **Create**. (This is not the name of the Teams app you already specified.)
    1. For now, select **No** for the link unfurling option.</br>

1. Select **Finish** at the bottom of the screen to configure your project.

## Identify relevant app project components

Much of the app manifest and scaffolding are set up automatically when you create your project with the Teams Toolkit.

### App manifest

The following snippet from the app manifest (the `manifest.json` file in your project's `.publish` directory) shows the properties and default values relevant to messaging extensions.

```JSON
"composeExtensions": [
    {
        "botId": "{botId0}",
        "canUpdateConfiguration": true,
        "commands": [
            {
                "id": "searchQuery",
                "context": [
                    "compose",
                    "commandBox"
                ],
                "description": "Test command to run query",
                "title": "Search",
                "type": "query",
                "parameters": [
                    {
                        "name": "searchQuery",
                        "title": "Search Query",
                        "description": "Your search query",
                        "inputType": "text"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
],
```

Let's understand some of the properties the toolkit created for you. (See the full list of supported [`composeExtensions`](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#composeextensions) properties.)

* `botId`: The ID of the bot you created setting up your project. (Stored in `{botId0}`, you can find the actual ID in `Development.env`.)
* `commands`: Available commands for the messaging extension. The toolkit provided you scaffolding for a search command.
* `context`: Where users can invoke the messaging extension. In this case, you can launch the messaging extension from the Teams compose or command box.
* `description`: UI help text indicating what the command does or how to use it.
* `parameters`: Includes all parameters a command accepts (you must have at least one and can have up to five).
* `parameters.description`: UI help text describing the parameter's purpose or example input.

### App scaffolding

The app scaffolding includes a `.env` file, located in the root directory of your project, which stores the ID and password of your messaging extension's bot.

Also in the root directory, there's a `botActivityHandler.js` file for handling how your messaging extension (or technically, the [messaging extension's bot](#configuring-the-bot-for-your-messaging-extension)) responds to search queries in Teams.

## Set up a secure tunnel to your app

For testing purposes, let's host your messaging extension on a local web server (port 3978).

1. In a terminal, run `ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978`.
1. Copy the HTTPS URL in the output since Teams requires HTTPS connections.
1. In your `.publish` directory, open `Development.env`.
1. Replace the `baseUrl0` value with the copied URL. (For example, change `baseUrl0=http://localhost:3000` to `baseUrl0=https://85528b2b3ca5.ngrok.io`.)

Your app manifest is pointing to where you're hosting the bot used by the messaging extension.

## Configuring the bot for your messaging extension

Messaging extensions rely on bots to send and process user requests from Teams to your hosted service.

The bot must be registered with the Azure Bot Service, which was done when you set up your app using the Teams Toolkit.

### Specify your bot ID and password

When your bot is registered with the Azure Bot Service, it's assigned an ID and password that your Teams app must know about.

1. Locate the bot ID and password you stored during toolkit setup.
1. In your root directory, open the `.env` file.
1. Set your bot ID and password to the `BotId` and `BotPassword` properties, respectively.

### Add the bot endpoint address

You must specify a bot endpoint URL to receive and process search queries in your messaging extension. Typically, the URL looks like `https://HOST_URL/api/messages`. You can configure this quickly in the Teams Toolkit.

1. In Visual Studio Code, select **Microsoft Teams** :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/vsc-toolkit.png"::: on the left Activity Bar and choose **Open Microsoft Teams Toolkit**.
1. Go to **Bot management > Existing bot registrations** and select the bot you created during setup.
1. In the **Bot endpoint address** field, enter the local web server where you're hosting the bot (`baseUrl10` value) and append `/api/messages` to it.

Your bot will be able to handle queries in your messaging extension.

## Run your app

You've set up a URL to host your messaging extension and configured it to handle searches. It's time to get your app up and running.

1. In a terminal, go to the root directory of your app project and run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

If successful, you see something like the following message indicating your messaging extension service is listening for activity at your `localhost`:

`Bot/ME service listening at http://localhost:3978`

## Sideload your bot in Teams

With your messaging extension running, you can install it in Teams.

> [!TIP]
> If you haven't sideloaded a Teams app before and run into issues, follow these [instructions](../build-your-first-app/build-and-run.md#sideload-your-app-in-teams).

1. Log in to the Teams client with your account that allows app sideloading.
1. Select **Apps**, then choose **Upload a custom app**.
1. Go to your app project `.publish` folder and select `Development.zip`.
1. In the install modal, select **Add** to install your app.

## Test your messaging extension

Learn how messaging extensions work in a Teams chat.

1. Start a new chat. In the compose box, and select **More** :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/teams-client-more.png"::: and choose the messaging extension app you just sideloaded.<br/>
   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/build-your-first-app/me-teams-access.png" alt-text="Illustration showing where you access a messaging extension in Teams.":::
1. Try searching for something (for example, "Tickets"). If your app is working, you'll see sample search results (you can add your own later).<br/>
   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/build-your-first-app/me-teams-test.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing a user trying a search-based messaging extension from the Teams compose box.":::

> [!NOTE]
> If you make code changes after testing your messaging extension—for example, you update `botActivityHandler.js`—you must run your app again to see those changes reflected in Teams.

## Well done

Congratulations! You have a basic Teams messaging extension that's set up to search for external content in the compose or command box.

## Next steps

See the following pages to continue and build a fully featured messaging extension:

1. [Define search commands](../messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command.md) that are relevant to your service.
1. Configure your service to [respond to users' searches](../messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/respond-to-search.md).

## Troubleshooting

The following information may help if you had issues completing this tutorial.

### Toolkit setup fails

While setting up your app project with the Teams Toolkit, you get an error after selecting the **Create a new Bot** option and logging in with your Microsoft 365 development account.

This could be an authentication issue. Follow these steps to finish setting up your project.

1. In Visual Studio Code, select **Microsoft Teams** :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/vsc-toolkit.png"::: on the left Activity Bar and choose **Sign out**.
1. Go through the setup process again by logging in with the same account and creating a new bot.

### Bot isn't connected to Teams

If you installed your app but it isn't working, make sure the messaging extension's bot is [connected to the Azure Bot Service's Teams *channel*](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

It's important to understand that this isn't the same as a channel in Teams. In this case, a channel is how the Azure Bot Service connects your bot to Teams or another [supported Microsoft or third-party communications app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channels-reference?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

# Get started building your first Teams app

In the **build your first app** lessons, you create basic Teams apps. Each tutorial walks through how to build a simple, real-world Teams app while introducing you to common tools, fundamental concepts, and some more advanced features.

## What you'll learn

Here's an idea of what you'll know after going through the lessons.

> [!div class="checklist"]
  >
  > * **Get up and running quickly with the Teams Toolkit**: The Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code takes care of creating your app project and scaffolding so you can have a running app in minutes.
  > * **Define your app with the manifest**: The app manifest is where you specify the capabilities and services your Teams app uses.
  > * **Scope your app's audience**: Build a Teams app for personal use, collaboration, or both.
  > * **Get experience with frameworks**: Customize your app (for example, change its color scheme to match the Teams theme) with help from the Teams JavaScript SDK. Also, learn about common tools for creating and managing bots.
  > * **Expand on your app**: Throughout the lessons, you'll find related topics you're probably interested in (such as authentication and design guidelines).

## Teams app fundamentals

Before you begin the tutorials, you should know the following about building apps for Teams.

### Apps can have multiple capabilities

Teams apps are made up of one or more [platform capabilities](../concepts/capabilities-overview.md). You can display these capabilities using a number of Teams-specific [UI components and conventions](../planning-your-app/teams-ui-conventions.md), such as cards and task modules.

### Teams doesn't host your app

A Teams app includes three important pieces:

* The logic, data storage, and API calls that power your app. These services are not hosted by Teams and must be accessible via HTTPS.
* The Teams client (web, desktop, or mobile) where people use your app.
* Your app package, which you use to install the app in Teams. It contains app metadata and pointers to your hosted services.

## Get prerequisites

Verify you have the right account for building Teams apps and install some recommended development tools.

### Set up your development account

You need a Teams account that allows custom app sideloading. (Your account may already provide this.)

1. If you have a Teams account, verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:
    1. In the Teams client, select **Apps**.
    1. Look for an option to **Upload a custom app**.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/build-your-first-app/upload-custom-app-closeup.png" alt-text="sideload option view":::

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<details>

<summary><b>Select here</b> if you can't see the sideload option or don't have a Teams account.</summary>

You can get a free Teams test account that allows app sideloading by joining the Microsoft 365 developer program. (The registration process takes approximately two minutes.)

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions. 
1. When you get to the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
1. Set up your administrator account. Once you finish, you should see a screen like this.
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.png" alt-text="dev program subscription view":::
1. Log in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up.
1. Verify if you now have the **Upload a custom app** option.

</details>

### Install your development tools

You can build Teams apps with your preferred tools, but these lessons show how you can get started quickly with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

Teams displays app content only through HTTPS connections. Since you'll host your first app locally to save time, you'll learn how to use [ngrok to set up a secure tunnel](../concepts/build-and-test/debug.md#locally-hosted) between Teams and your app. (Production-level Teams apps are hosted in the cloud.)

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
1. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).
1. Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). (Earlier versions might not work with the toolkit.)
1. In Visual Studio Code, select **Extensions** :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/vs-code-extensions.png"::: on the left Activity Bar and install the **Microsoft Teams Toolkit**.

## About the tutorials

The Teams **build your first app** lessons are independent and you can start from anywhere you want. If you're not sure where to go, follow our beginner friendly path and build a "Hello, World!" app.

## Next step

Once you set up your account and environment, you can start building.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Build a "Hello, World!" app](../build-your-first-app/build-and-run.md)

Or you can choose to:

* [Build a bot](../build-your-first-app/add-bot.md)
* [Build a messaging extension](../build-your-first-app/build-messaging-extension.md)

- title: Prerequisites
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |
   Ensure you install the following tools for building and deploying your apps.
   | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | &nbsp; | [Teams Toolkit](#install-the-teams-toolkit) | A Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest prerelease version. |
   | &nbsp; | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
   | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. Use the latest version. |

   ## Prepare development environment
   After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.
   ### Install the Teams Toolkit
   The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    
   You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code, or CLI (command-line interface), called `TeamsFx`.
   # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)
   1. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
   1. In the search box, enter **Teams Toolkit**.
   1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

    The Teams Toolkit  :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon appears in the Visual Studio Code **Activity Bar** after it's installed.
   You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).
   # [Command line](#tab/cli)
   To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:
   ``` bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```
   Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:
   ``` bash
   sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```
   This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.
   Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  
   You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.
   > [!CAUTION]
   > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the "remote signed" execution policy for PowerShell.

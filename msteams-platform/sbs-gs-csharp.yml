    Here's a list of tools you'll need to install for building and deploying a Teams app.

    | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | &nbsp; | [Latest version of Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com/download)<br> Install one of the following two workloads:<br> • **ASP.NET and web development** <br> • **.NET Core cross-platform development** | .NET. You can install the free community edition of Visual Studio 2019, and install the workloads also. |
    | &nbsp; | [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | Git to use the Sample C# app repo from GitHub. |
    | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bot and message extension) require inbound connections. You need to expose your development system to Teams through a tunnel. A tunnel is not required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
    | &nbsp; | [Teams Toolkit](#install-teams-toolkit) | A Visual Studio 2019 extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use latest version. |
    | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, call - all in one place. |
    | **Optional** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | &nbsp; | [Azure Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) and [Microsoft Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) | Azure tools to access stored data or to deploy a cloud-based backend for your Teams app in Azure. |
    

    ## Verify git installation

    If Visual Studio installation prompts you to add `git` to the path, select it. 
   
    To verify the version of git installed:

    1. Open a terminal window. 
    2. Run the following command to verify the `git` version installed on your machine:

        ```bash
        $ git --version
        ```

        Output example: `git version 2.17.1.windows.2`

    ## Install Teams Toolkit

    Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to create a project scaffolding for your app. It creates the necessary directory structure for all selected capabilities with the required files in place, ready to build the project.

    Teams Toolkit is available as an extension in Visual Studio.

    To install Teams Toolkit extension:

    1. Open Visual Studio and select the **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/select-extension.png" alt-text="Select Extensions.":::

       The following Manage Extension page appears:

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/manage-extension.png" alt-text="Manage Extensions.":::

    1. Select **Installed** and you can see Teams Toolkit extension is installed by default.
    
       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/select-ttk.png" alt-text="Select Teams Toolkit":::
       
    You also can find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msft-vsteamstoolkit.vsteamstoolkit).

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

    ### Check for sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you will not be able to preview and test your app in Teams locally.
    
    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If Teams doesn't show the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
    1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears:

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.png" alt-text="Example of what you see after signing up for the Microsoft 365 developer program.":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

    ## Get a free Azure account

    If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. Create a free account before you begin.

    Now you’ve got all tools and set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building! Select the app you want to do first

    You've done it!

    You've created a tab app.

    Now that you've learned to create a basic app, you can move on to creating more complex apps. To start with, try adding capabilities to your existing apps.

    That's it! Teams Toolkit adds the scaffolding for the new capability to your app's directory structure.

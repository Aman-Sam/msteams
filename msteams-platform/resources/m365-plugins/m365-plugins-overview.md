# Plugins Introduction

The Microsoft 365 Plugins are designed by Microsoft to support integration between Moodle sites and Microsoft Teams. We currently have seven (7) plugins, which can be used independently, or in collaboration, to achieve various usage scenarios. You may find the full list of supported plugins [here](https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=set:microsoft-365). As you review the descriptions below, and the documentation on GitHub, please post any comments or issues at the dedicated GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/microsoft/o365-moodle/issues).

# Microsoft 365 Repository

* Using the Microsoft 365 Repository plugin, the teachers have two choices to store the course files in OneDrive.
* Each course has its own folder created in OneDrive, which allows teachers to add files from the course files area of OneDrive or from their own personal space.  
* Users can choose to add the file to Moodle as a copy or make a link to the file. 
* A linked file can then be displayed in a new window or embedded in the page. 
* The OneDrive repository plugin also allows users to upload files to OneDrive/SharePoint from the Moodle file picker.

It also offers the benefit of using Microsoft 365 as a file repository for an institution while keeping Moodle's data structure simple.

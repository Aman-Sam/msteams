# Microsoft 365 Repository

Microsoft 365 offers benefit of using it as a file repository for an institution while keeping Moodle's data structure simple. The Microsoft 365 repository plugin provides the following services:

* The teachers can store the course files in OneDrive. Each course has its own folder created in OneDrive, which allows teachers to add files from the course files area of OneDrive or from their own personal space.  
* Users can choose to add the file to Moodle as a copy or make a link to the file. The linked file displays in a new window or is embedded in the page.
* Users can upload files to OneDrive or SharePoint from the Moodle file picker.

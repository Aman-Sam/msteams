# Teams Meetings

Teams meetings can be created using the Atto Editor in Calendar, Assignments, Forum posts, or wherever Atto Editor is available.

* After the plugin is installed, educators and students can create an audio or video meeting from Moodle. 

* Requires Microsoft 365 account and Moodle permissions to create meetings.

## Limitation

Teams meetings do not appear on Outlook/Teams calenders, however, individual student names can be added to the invite for this purpose.

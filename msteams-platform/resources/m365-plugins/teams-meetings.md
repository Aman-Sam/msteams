# Teams Meetings

Teams meetings can be created using the Atto editor in calendar, assignments, forum posts, or wherever Atto editor is available. After the plugin is installed, teachers and students can create an audio or video meeting from Moodle. It require Microsoft 365 account and Moodle permissions to create meetings.

>[!NOTE]
>Teams meetings don't appear on Outlook or Teams calenders, however, individual student names can be added to the invite for the same.

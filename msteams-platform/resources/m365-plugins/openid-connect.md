# OpenID Connect

The OpenID Connect plugin is used to authenticate users against any site or authentication tool that supports the OpenID Connect specification. It is used to provide single sign on support with Microsoft Office 365.

The OpenID Connect provides institutions with two login workflows options to meet their specific needs: 
* Users may use their Office 365 email and password to login directly using Moodleâ€™s username and password fields, without signing into Office 365
* Users may click a link to login through Office 365 or the OpenID Connect provider on a Moodle page

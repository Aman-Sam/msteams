The OpenID Connect provides institutions with the following sign-in workflow options to meet their specific needs:

* Users can enter their Office 365 credentials, such as email and password to sign in directly using Moodleâ€™s username and password fields, without signing into Office 365.
* Users can select the link to sign in through Office 365 or the OpenID Connect provider on a Moodle page.

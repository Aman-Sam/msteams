The OpenID Connect provides institutions with the following sign-in workflow options to meet their specific needs:

* Users may use their Office 365 email and password to sign in directly using Moodleâ€™s username and password fields, without signing into Office 365
* Users may select a link to sign in through Office 365 or the OpenID Connect provider on a Moodle page 

For more information on documentation, installation instructions, and support, see:

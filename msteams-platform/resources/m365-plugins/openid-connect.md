# OpenID Connect

The OpenID Connect plugin authenticates users against any site or authentication tool that supports the OpenID Connect specification. It is used to provide single-sign-on support with Microsoft Office 365.

The OpenID Connect provides institutions with two sign in workflows options to meet their specific needs: 

* Users may use their Office 365 email and password to sign in directly using Moodleâ€™s username and password fields, without signing into Office 365
* Users may click a link to sign in through Office 365 or the OpenID Connect provider on a Moodle page

# OneNote Integrations

The bundle of three (3) plugins allow Moodle users to take advantage of Microsoft OneNote Online. 

* Includes browsing notebooks, sections, and pages; students doing assignments in OneNote and teachers providing feedback on those assignments in OneNote.

* Submission or feedback events trigger OneNote creation with a section for each courses the student is enrolled.

* Combines a digital binder for notes, assignments, and feedback for reference and review. 

* Expands note taking capabilities beyond just text and links, and extends mobile usage scenarios using digital pens, photo/video media, and coauthoring with groups.

* Includes a submission and feedback page for each assignment under the teacher's account. Consequently, when such a page is saved within Moodle, a copy of the HTML and any associated pictures are packaged up in a zip file.

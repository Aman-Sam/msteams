# OneNote Integrations

The bundle of three (3) plugins allows Moodle users to take advantage of Microsoft OneNote Online. 

* This includes browsing notebooks, sections, and pages; students doing assignments in OneNote and teachers providing feedback on those assignments in OneNote.
* Submission or feedback events trigger OneNote creation with a section for each course the student is enrolled in.
* Consolidating a digital binder for notes, assignments, and feedback for reference and review. * Leveraging OneNote expands note taking capabilities beyond just text and links, and extends mobile usage scenarios using digital pens, photo/video media, and coauthoring with groups. 
* It has a submission and feedback page for each assignment for each student in the teacher's account. Correspondingly, each such page, when it gets saved inside Moodle, has a copy of the HTML and any associates images, all zipped up in a zip file.

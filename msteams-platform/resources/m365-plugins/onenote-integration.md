# OneNote Integrations

The bundle of three (3) plugins allow Moodle users to take advantage of Microsoft OneNote Online. 

* Includes browsing notebooks, sections, and pages; where students do assignments in OneNote and teachers provide feedback on those assignments in OneNote.

* Submission or feedback events trigger OneNote creation with a section for each course the student is enrolled.

* Combines a digital binder for notes, assignments, and feedback for reference and review. 

* Expands note-taking capabilities beyond just text and links, and extends mobile usage scenarios using digital pens, photo/video media, and coauthoring with groups.

* Includes a submission and feedback page for each assignment under the teacher's account.When such a page is saved within Moodle, a copy of the HTML and any associated pictures are packaged up in a zip file.

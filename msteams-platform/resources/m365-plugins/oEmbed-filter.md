# oEmbed Filter

The oEmbed filter is a powerful filter that simplifies the inclusion of external HTML content within Moodle.

* Reduces the amount of time it takes an instructor to add a video to an HTML page.

* Does not require a technical understanding of how to copy embed code from any of the supported services.

* Does not require YouTube API key for video embedding.

* Enables embedding of multiple video content providers.

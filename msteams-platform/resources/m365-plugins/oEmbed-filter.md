# oEmbed Filter

The oEmbed filter is a powerful filter that simplifies the inclusion of external HTML content within Moodle. 

[Place holder for image]


* It reduces the amount of time it takes an instructor to add a video to an HTML page.
* Does not require a technical understanding of how to copy embed code from any of the supported services
* Does not require YouTube API key for video embedding
* Enables embedding of multiple video content providers (not just YouTube)

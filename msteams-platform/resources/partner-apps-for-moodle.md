# Partner apps for Moodle

Partner apps for Moodle are examples of complete apps for Microsoft Teams that are currently available in the Microsoft Market. 
You can locate these apps within the Microsoft Teams App Store, and enjoy their value immediately. Microsoft works closely with partners to certify app quality and to validate all Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings.

## Key benefits of partner apps for Moodle:

* Extend Teams to fit your needs: Install and engage with apps designed by education focused experts for improved student engagement and collaboration.

* Enjoy less context switching: Rather than having Moodle and Teams users sign in to multiple services, enable them to be more productive within Teams with easy single sign-on access to Moodle courses, data, and activities. 

* Super-charge meetings, conversations, and document shares with the proven benefits of the worldwide Moodle LMS value built on top of the platform for instructor enablement and student engagement.

## mConnect

* The mConnect app is a Microsoft certified app that integrates Moodle courses and activities into Teams for learning experiences empowered by leading-edge collaboration and productivity services in the cloud. The app is developed and supported by Skooler, a long-standing, and trusted Microsoft Gold Partner in Education.

* The mConnect app allows Moodle administrators to automatically set up a Team for every Moodle course, making all functionality offered through Teams instantly available for every course in Moodle.

This app may be added from the Microsoft Teams App store if customers have a pre-existing account with Skooler, and this app requires an admin to configure it directly from the Moodle site.

# Make your app more discoverable with search

The search function in Microsoft Teams presents a great opportunity to promote your app to users who might not discover it on their own. Once an app is added to a team, all team members will see it in search results. It'll be included even when it’s only a partial match. There's also a link from Search to "Discover apps" where anyone using Teams can find your app.

## Guidelines

A search for your app will deliver the following components and information:

### Your app name

Make it something short and memorable.

### Your icon

We use your full-color square icon and apply rounded corners for apps, hexagonal shape for bots.

### A description

Provide one line of text that summarizes your app’s capabilities and gives initial directions about installation.

> [!TIP]
> Icons render at 32px in the search auto-suggest menu, so make sure your icon is clearly legible at that size.

## Best practices

### Make a good first impression

Present a clean, colorful icon and a simple app name.

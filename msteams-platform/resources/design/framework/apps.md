# Showcase your app

The area on the left side of Microsoft Teams where your activity feed, chat, teams, files, and meetings buttons live. We designed it to serve as a central container giving users quick access to the features that they use the most.

When someone downloads your app from the store, it’ll initially only appear in the apps overflow menu. However, users have the option of pinning their favorite apps here. When you write an app, do your best to encourage users to pin it.

## Guidelines

### Create tabs for individual users

Make sure to consider the experience of a single user as well as an entire team. For example, if your service is a notetaking app, add a tab that holds personal notes. That way, a user can refer to their own notes whenever they like without having to share them with an entire team.

### Encourage someone to click

When someone navigates to the App gallery, they’ll be able to search for your app (either by name or category). Your app will appear as a tile in a collection. That tile will include your app name, icon, and a short two-line description of what your service does. Clicking on your tile will open a profile page that contains a lot more info. Make sure to sell yourself in this longer description. Let someone know what your app does, what categories it falls into, and what skills your bot or app has. (See Submitting your app)

### Add some custom tabs

You get a dedicated space for your app in Microsoft Teams. Once a user opens your app they’ll be directed to a dedicated area that will have tabs. If your service deals with content on an individual level as well as on the team level, include some additional tabs here that contain information catering to individuals (i.e. “Me” tabs).

Here are a few examples of tabs that showcase user-specific content

* **Task list**: If your service involves task management, consider creating a tab for your app that shows all tasks assigned to the current user.

* **Contact list bot**: If you built a bot that creates contact cards, consider creating a tab that lists each contact the bot has created for the user.

* **Meme maker**: If your app is primarily a message extension for inserting memes, you might make a tab that shows a history of memes the user has created.

### Include user-specific settings

If your app involves per-user settings, include them in a tab. Team settings are handled at the team level.

### Customize your About tab

Your app will have its own About tab containing some general publishing information by default, but we recommend replacing this tab with your own “about” or “help” content. You could include version details, contact details, and specific instructions about how to use your app in Microsoft Teams.

## Best practices

### Add personalized information

Adding information that highlights how your app can be useful to an individual user will go a long way toward encouraging them to use it, pin it, and talk about it.

### Make your own Help tab

Help people use your product by writing step-by-step instructions and including them in your Help tab. Don’t forget to update it as you make changes to your app.

### Make a great set of icons

You’ll need more than one icon to represent your app throughout Microsoft Teams. Your icon is the first thing people will see in the app store, so make sure it looks good!

> [!TIP]
> Make sure the icons you submit look great everywhere in the app. Be certain your icons display well when scaled down.

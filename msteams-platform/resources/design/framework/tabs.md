# Content and conversations, all at once

Tabs are canvases that you can use to share content, hold conversations, and host third-party services, all within a team’s organic workflow. When you build a tab in Microsoft Teams, it puts your web app front and center where it’s easily accessible from key conversations.

## Guidelines

A good tab should display the following characteristics:

### Focused functionality

Tabs work best when they’re built to address a specific need. Focus on a small set of tasks or a subset of data that’s relevant to the channel the tab is in.

### Reduced chrome

Avoid creating multiple panels in a tab, adding layers of navigation, or requiring users to scroll both vertically and horizontally in one tab. In other words, try not to have tabs in your tab.

### Integration

Find ways to notify users about tab activity by posting cards to a conversation, for example.

### Conversational

Find a way to facilitate conversation around a tab. This ensures that conversations center on the content, data, or process at hand.

### Streamlined access

Make sure you’re granting access to the right people at the right time. Keeping your sign-in process simple will avoid creating barriers to contribution and collaboration.

### Personality

Your tab canvas presents a good opportunity to brand your experience. Incorporate your own logos, colors, and layouts to communicate personality.

Your logo is an important part of your identity and a connection with your users. So be sure to include it.

* Place your logo in the left or right corner or along the bottom edge
* Keep your logo small and unobtrusive

## Best practices

### Always include a default state

Include a default state to make tabs easy to set up even if your tab is configurable.

### Deep linking

Whenever possible, cards and bots should deep link to richer data in a hosted tab. For example, a card may show a summary of bug data, but clicking it can shows the entire bug in a tab.

### Naming

In many cases, the name of your app may make a great tab name. But consider naming your tabs according to the functionality they provide.

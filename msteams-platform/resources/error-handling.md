**Code**: Not Available <br>**Message**:Admin Permissions Consent window does not close back after granting or cancelling permissions in the Desktop/ Mac Teams app. | A developer is building a Microsoft Teams Tab application that requires opening the admin permissions consent page within the app. The consent window works fine on the web version of the application, but on the Desktop/ Mac Teams app, the window does not close after granting or cancelling permissions. <br> Source: [View](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73235113/ms-teams-tab-app-is-not-closing-back-the-admin-permissions-consent-window-in-the) | 1. Do not mix Teams Tab SSO supports and the idea of having an admin do a pre-consent in the same place. Provide a separate link for admin to pre-consent or rely on the standard SSO experience. 2. Use 'microsoftTeams.authentication.getAuthToken' which handles SSO better than 'authentication.authenticate'. 3. Your redirect page should call the 'notifySuccess(…)' method to close the login screen. 4. Mark your app as 'needs admin pre-approval' and set 'defaultBlockUntilAdminAction' to 'true' and 'publisherDocsUrl' to the page with the instructions for the admin.
**Code**: VM5:2 <br>**Message**:Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow': The target origin provided does not match the recipient window's origin. | The developer is trying to initialize a Teams application with a Tab that serves each tenant their own self-hosted version of the app. The initialization fails when trying to redirect to the tenant specific app. <br> Source: [View](https://github.com/officedev/microsoft-teams-library-js/issues/1378) | Ensure that all possible domains are listed in the 'validDomains' field of the manifest. Also, experiment with the 'validMessageOrigins' option in 'app.initialize()'. If the issue persists, check if there are any child windows/frames involved in the scenario.
**Code**: Not Available <br>**Message**:getTabInstances API does not resolve in personal chat and on mobile. | The developer is trying to get Tab information for a personal chat using getTabInstances API, but it never resolves. The same behavior is observed on mobile as well. <br> Source: [View](https://github.com/officedev/microsoft-teams-library-js/issues/1487) | The getTabInstances API is not implemented on mobile and it's performance is poor. It is advised not to use it as it will get deprecated. Instead, use the Graph APIs to know what tabs are pinned in a given chat or channel. The links to these APIs are: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/chat-list-tabs?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/channel-list-tabs?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http. Keep in mind that using these APIs may require extra permissions on the app registration.
**Code**: 100 <br>**Message**:`registerBeforeUnloadHandler` does not work for mobile devices. | The developer is trying to use `registerBeforeUnloadHandler` and `registerOnLoadHandler` in a custom Teams app on mobile devices. The functions work well on Web and Desktop Teams but not on iOS and Android Teams. <br> Source: [View](https://github.com/officedev/microsoft-teams-library-js/issues/1445) | Currently, there is no alternative to `registerBeforeUnloadHandler` for mobile devices and there are no plans to support it in the future. The developer can suggest this feature in the Microsoft Teams Community.

## Apps in meetings

|Error message                 |Scenario                                |Resolution |
|:-----------------------------|:---------------------------------------|:---------|
|No specific error code <br>**Reason**: Session ID changes every time the page is reloaded in the custom app on MS Teams Desktop App.|A custom app in Microsoft Teams Desktop App uses cookies and a session ID to keep track of temporary settings for tasks. The issue is session ID changes on every page  reload.|         |
|BadArgument <br>**Reason**: Unknown attachment type     |The developer is trying to attach a PDF file to a Microsoft Teams bot and encounters an error.        |Avoid using cookies in Teams apps as they can cause issues when switching between Desktop and Web or different devices. Instead, store state server-side in a database or other store, keyed on the user's AadObject ID (their unique Azure Active Directory user guid), which remains consistent across all platforms.|
|Upload failed File size too large <br>**Reason**: The file size limit for Adobe eSign feature is 10 MB.| The error occurred when trying to attach files over 10 MB using the Teams 'Approvals' App for eSignature and Approvals of documents.|Ensure that the file size doesn't exceed the limit set by Adobe eSign feature, which is 10 MB. If larger files need to be attached, consider compressing the files or using a different method to send them.|
|OnTeamsMeetingStartAsync() and OnTeamsMeetingEndAsync() methods are not being called in a specific tenant, but work in a local demo tenant.|The developer is trying to use OnTeamsMeetingStartAsync() and OnTeamsMeetingEndAsync() methods in a specific tenant, but they're not being called. However, these methods work in a local demo tenant.| <br> 1. Confirm that the feature is available in public developer preview. <br> 2. Ensure that 'OnlineMeeting.ReadBasic.Chat' permission is added. <br> 3. Check the configuration of group owner consent settings for RSC in a team using the Azure AD portal. <br> 4. Use Graph explorer to check whether the correct RSC permission is associated with the bot|

## Adaptive card

|Error message           |Scenario                               |Resolution  |
|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------|:---------|
|Unable to render dynamic data inside the AdaptiveCard template for user mentions in Teams.| The developer is trying to create a dynamic AdaptiveCard to mention users in Teams. They're facing an issue with rendering dynamic data inside the template. They have tried to serialize a JSON with the same $data structure with the name of the user mentioned but it doesn't render anything.        |Currently, there's no support for sending a dynamic array to the entity property in Microsoft Teams. For mentioning a user, you need to repeat the entity block, not the text block. For more information, see [Adaptive Cards Template Language](/adaptive-cards/templating/language)|
|URL with double quotes in Adaptive Card action isn't opening in Microsoft Teams on iOS.|A developer is using Logic Apps to generate Actions in an Adaptive Card and pass a URL with double quotes. When the Adaptive Card is sent to Microsoft Teams and the action button is clicked, the URL doesn't open.|Verify the URL and try with a different URL. Ensure that the URL is properly encoded to handle special characters like double quotes. Test the behavior on different platforms (Teams web, desktop, and iOS) to isolate the issue. If the problem persists, report the issue with all the relevant details for further investigation.|
|Adaptive Cards aren't fully occupying width in MS Teams Group Channel despite setting the 'width: full' property.|The developer is trying to render Adaptive Cards in MS Teams Group Channel with full width. Despite setting the 'width: full' property, the Adaptive Card aren't occupying the full width.|The  engineering team fixed the issue and rolled out the fix to the organization's tenant. The developer should ensure they're using the latest version of MS Teams Desktop and Web version in channel scope.|
|ReplyToId is coming null when user performs any action on the adaptive card in the emulator.|Developer is testing an adaptive card with yes/no action items in the emulator. When a user clicks on yes/no, the developer wants to update the card with a thank you message. However, the ReplyToId, which is needed for the update, is coming as null.|<br> 1. Verify the version of the Bot Framework Emulator being used. It's recommended to use version V4. <br> 2. Test the adaptive card again in the emulator. <br> 3. If the issue persists, share a screen recording of the issue for further investigation.|
|Microsoft Teams doesn't post back the Data property of Action.Submit if it's a string.|The developer is trying to send a Card to Teams with an Action.Submit's Data set to a string. However, Teams doesn't send it back in the value property of the message event. If the Data is an object, then Teams sends it back.|Currently, there's no workaround for this issue. The issue has been raised as a bug and is under investigation. Monitor the original GitHub issue for updates.|
|BadSyntax Failed to read card payload as JSON| The developer is trying to add color to the text in an adaptive card using conditions in a bot that generates adaptive cards into the channel.|First, install the Adaptive Card Templating for JavaScript library. Then, use the 'if' condition to set the color to 'good' and 'attention'. Make sure to use the 'ACData.Template' function on your cardJson before expanding it with your data. Finally, use the resulting 'finalCardJson' to send an adaptive card in the channel or as per your use case.|
|209 Invoke validation failed. <br> **Reason** User forbidden to perform action|The developer is trying to use the 'Refresh' action in an adaptive card in a one-to-one chat in Teams. The action works for the developer but not for the other user in the chat. The error occurs after the Teams cache is cleared and the chat is opened in a browser.|The issue was resolved by adding a bot at the launch of the messaging extension. The bot wasn't automatically added to the 'groupchat'. The developer used the 'OnTeamsMessagingExtensionFetchTaskAsync' method to check if the app is installed by fetching member information. If the bot isn't in the conversation roster, the 'GetAddMissedBotCard' method is called to add the bot.|
|The response from the Teams Adaptive Card isn't being recorded in the Azure Logic App.|The developer is trying to capture the input text from a Teams Adaptive Card and use it in their Azure Logic App, but the response isn't being recorded.|Ensure to use the 'Post adaptive card and wait for a response' action if you expect a response from the card. The output of this action doesn't give any output options, so you have to format it yourself. Use 'Parse json' and enter input in the expression field: @Outputs('adaptivecardname')?[body]|

|unknownAuthError <br>**Reason**: The error occurs when the authentication.getAuthToken() function is called, returning Error: unknownAuthError.| The developer is trying to get tokens from the current user logged in on Teams Desktop App using the authentication.getAuthToken() function in the Teams SDK. The error occurs when testing on Teams Desktop client (both Windows and macOS).|There are several possible resolutions. First, proactively check for token expiration and ask the user to sign in again if the ID token isn't valid. Second, catch the error in a callback passed into the acquiretoken ADAL JS function and ask the user to sign in again if the error occurs. Third, whitelist the login.microsoftonline.com endpoint in your browser extension or re-enable third party cookies in your browser if they're disabled. Lastly, add two client applications to Authorized client applications in Azure portal for the Teams desktop/mobile clients and the web client: 5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346 and 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264.|
|SSO-Token SSO Token isn't getting generated for some users in Azure AD.|The issue occurs when users enter the Una Chat Bot in MS Teams. The SSO Token should be automatically generated for all users, but it's not happening for some.|Update the Teams version and check again. If the issue persists, ensure that the application is correctly registered through Azure Active Directory for SSO. Check the user permissions and roles in Azure AD. If the problem continues, escalate the issue using the provided link.|
|OAuth token for user authentication isn't working on iOS 16.|The developer is using an OAuth token from an HTTP response to authenticate users. The authentication works on Android, desktop, and web platforms, but fails on iOS 16.|<br> 1. Check if the issue is specific to iOS 16 or all iOS versions. <br> 2.

Ensure that the cookie settings are in line with the recommendations in the Microsoft Teams platform documentation. <br> 4. If the issue persists, escalate it using the provided link.|
|53001 <br>**Reason**: The error message is about incompatible browsers and authentication failure of a custom Teams app due to Conditional Access policy.|The developer is trying to authenticate a custom Teams app for a customer who has a Conditional Access policy that restricts browsers. The user is presented with a 53001 error and a message about incompatible browsers.|The developer should ensure that the customer is using a domain joined device as the Conditional Access policy requires it. If the device isn't domain joined, it gives a 53001 error. If the issue persists, the developer should check the browser compatibility and update the browser details in the Teams app.|
|CORS Access to XMLHttpRequest at [https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token) from origin has been blocked by CORS policy.|The developer is trying to enable SSO for a Teams App and is using client-side code to acquire a token using MSAL. The token API is failing due to a CORS issue in both local and development environments.|The 'OnBehalfOf' token call should only be made from a backend server, where CORS wouldn't apply. The only call that needs to be made from the front-end code is 'microsoftTeams.authentication.getAuthToken()'. It's recommended to review the linked video and blog post for a more detailed understanding.|
|SDK initialization timed out <br>**Reason**: The error message indicates that the SDK initialization is timing out when trying to authenticate with Adobe ID in a Teams app.|The developer is trying to implement simple authentication in a Microsoft Teams app using Adobe ID as a third-party OAuth provider. However, an exception is thrown when the 'app.initialize()' function is called, stating that the SDK initialization has timed out.|The developer should confirm the SDK version and MS Teams version being used. They should also try using 'microsoftTeams.app.initialize().then(() => { })' to see if it resolves the issue.

|403 CSRF token validation failed|The error occurs when trying to trigger a PATCH request via HTTP AZURE Gateway from Power Virtual Agent BOT to S/4 HANA through OData v2 service. The CSRF token is fetched and stored in a local variable and passed to PATCH request. The error is seen in Power Automate Flow.
|The issue is with the Microsoft on-premise-gateway, which is used to connect your OData service. The on-premise-gateway always establishes a new HTTP connection that expires the X-CSRF-TOKEN. Wait for a version that supports this or try a different method to connect your OData service.|
|Azure Teams Bot stops responding after a few minutes of operation in Teams.|A bot developed for Teams using Azure Bot Service and C# works well in local environment using Bot Framework Emulator, but stops responding after some time in Teams. Uninstalling and reinstalling the bot temporarily resolves the issue but it reoccurs.|Downgrade the .NET version and SDK version to 3.14. Implement a BotJwtRefreshWorker class that refreshes the bot's token every 30 minutes. This ensures that the bot always has a valid token and reduces or eliminates the waiting time.|
|Bad Request - Error in query syntax <br>**Reason**: Error in the GetUserProfile query syntax in Power Virtual Agents Flow Template|The developer is trying to get detailed user information using Microsoft Virtual Agent in Microsoft Teams. The error occurs when the developer tries to get the user's email by calling SearchForUsers() and then GetUserProfile().|Instead of passing in display name, pass in UserID. This eliminates the need for the call to SearchForUsers().|

# DevTools for the Microsoft Teams Desktop Client

When Teams is running in a browser, it’s easy to access the browser's DevTools: F12 (on Windows) or Command-Option-I (on MacOS).

While the web version of Teams and the desktop version of teams are almost exactly the same, there are some differences, particularly with respect to authentication. Sometimes the only way to figure out what’s going on is to use the DevTools. Here's how to get to them from the Teams desktop client.

The feature is only available in the Developer Preview version of Microsoft Teams. See [How do I get access to the Developer Preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-features) for more information.

## Accessing DevTools in the Teams Client

To use DevTools in the desktop client, first open up a tab so you have something to inspect with the DevTools, then open DevTools:

* On Windows, you open DevTools via the Microsoft Teams icon in the desktop tray:

* On MacOS, you open DevTools by clicking on the Microsoft Teams icon in the Dock.

Here’s what a sample tab looks like with the DevTools open and an element selected:

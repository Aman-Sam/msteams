# How do I get access to the Developer Prevew?

To participate in the Public Developer Preview, you need to do the following:

1. Turn on the setting for enabling uploading of apps in the admin console of your tenant as described [here](~/msteams-platform/get-started/get-started-tenant).

2. Right-click on your profile (either in the upper right or lower left of the Teams interface) to display the Teams menu. The developer preview option is found in About→Developer preview. If you do not see an entry for Developer preview the most likely reason is that the tenant is not configured for app uploading as described in step 1.

Note that enabling Developer Preview might result in messages that don't render correctly for others using the official version of the Teams client.

## How do I turn it off?

Use the same menu item under About → Developer preview, and click on it to turn it off.

## What features will I have access to?

See [Features in the Public Developer Preview](~/msteams-platform/resources/general/developer-preview-features).

# Features in the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams

The following are available to users of the Public Developer Preview ring. See [What is the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams?](~/msteams-platform/resources/general/developer-preview) for more information on enabling it for your development tenant.

The following features are available in the Public Developer Preview as of December 12, 2017.

## Apps in Microsoft Teams

Apps in Microsoft Teams allow you to make your service available to users through a single Teams App package, which includes bots, tabs, connectors and messaging extensions. Learn more [here](~/msteams-platform/overview).

### Store

The Store provides a listing of all apps available in Microsoft Teams spanning various categories. Developers can add their apps by [submitting their apps to the Office Store](~/msteams-platform/publishing/apps-publish).

### Messaging extensions

Messaging extensions make it easy for users to query for information from your service and post them into conversations in the form of rich cards. Learn more [here](~/msteams-platform/concepts/-extensimessaging-extensions).

### Activity feed

Activity feed support allows apps to send messages using the Bot Framework without having to implement a conversational bot. It also enables your apps to mark messages as important and to post messages to the activity feed. Learn more [here](~/msteams-platform/concepts/activity-feed).

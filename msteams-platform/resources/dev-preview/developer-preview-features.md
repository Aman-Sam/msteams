# Features in the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams

The developer preview includes the following new features:

## Embed Share-to-Teams button on your website

You can now embed a Share-to-Teams button on your website that will insert a message into a channel. For Education tenants, you can also create an assigment from an external website using the same functionality. See [Share-to-Teams](~/share-to-teams.md).

## Calls and online meeting bots

With the addition of [Microsoft Graph APIs for calls and online meetings](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/resources/calls-api-overview.md), Microsoft Teams apps can now interact with users in rich ways using voice and video. These APIs allow you to add new app features such as interactive voice response (IVR), call control, and access to real-time audio and/or video streams for calls and meetings, including desktop and app sharing.

We've added a new section on how to create and develop calls and online meetings bots, starting with the [overview](~/concepts/calls-and-meetings/calls-meetings-bots-overview.md).

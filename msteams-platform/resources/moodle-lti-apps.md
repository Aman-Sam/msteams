# Moodle LTI Apps

Microsoft has heard your feedback regarding the need for Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) for the Moodle LMS. As a result, we are working to extend LTI entry points for Moodle Users in calendar year 2022. In the meanwhile, the following are currently available:

## OneDrive LTI App

OneDrive LTI app will help educators and students for a more modern experience with their OneDrive files inside an LMS, that includes the following:

* Access personal OneDrive files from within LMS
* Access class files in shared ODSP libraries from within LMS
* Allow users to easily share files using sharing links within the LMS

## Class Teams LTI App

With the new Class Teams LTI app, educators and students can easily navigate between Teams and their courses in LMS. 

Based on the enrolment roster of the LMS course, educators can do the following:
 
* Create a Class Team with the proper user roles within an LMS course
* Support Teams admin and adhere to LMS privacy policies during Class Team creation

After creating the Class Team, educators and students can do the following:
* Access the Team from within the LMS course or Teams
* Engage across desktop, mobile, and web platforms 

## Teams Meetings LTI App

The Microsoft Teams Meetings LTI app will help educators and students easily to integrate class meetings into their courses. Use the Teams Meetings LTI app to do the following:

* Schedule individual or recurring meetings within the course in LMS and set meeting options 
* View past & upcoming meetings within the LMS course calendar
* Join or edit the details of a Teams meeting from the LMS course
* Engage across desktop and web platforms

> [!NOTE]
> Initial release will not support channel meetings, the display of meeting recordings, or syncing of meetings with the LMS calendar.

# Features in the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams

The following are available to users of the Public Developer Preview ring. See [What is the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams?](~/resources/general/developer-preview) for more information on enabling it for your development tenant.

The following features are available in the Public Developer Preview as of December 12, 2017.

## Apps in Microsoft Teams

Apps in Microsoft Teams allow you to make your service available to users through a single Teams App package, which includes bots, tabs, connectors and messaging extensions. Learn more [here](~/overview).

## Store

The Store provides a listing of all apps available in Microsoft Teams spanning various categories. Developers can get apps in here by [submitting their apps to the Office Store](~/publishing/apps-publish).

## Messaging extensions

Messaging extensions make it easy for users to query for information from your service and post them into conversations in the form of rich cards. Learn more [here](~/concepts/compose-extensions).

## App notifications

App notifications allow apps to send messages using the Bot Framework without having to implement a conversational bot. It also enables them to mark messages as important and to post messages to the activity feed. Learn more [here](~/concepts/activity-feed).

# Overview

[Moodle](https://moodle.com/about/) is the world’s largest open-source learning management system. With over 30 years of experience in remote learning, Moodle has attracted around 300 million users worldwide with its rich set of services, both hosted and cloud-based.
 
The Moodle LMS partners beautifully with Microsoft Teams; combining Teams secure best-in-class collaboration and productivity services such audio/video, calling, and chat, with student course and activity management, badges and rewards, and analytical insights from both Moodle and Teams, resulting in modern superpowers in learning experiences. 

Moodle LMS mainly consists of following sections as shown in flowchart.

If you're wondering why anyone would want to combine Microsoft's cloud services with Moodle's courses and data, here are a few use cases to consider. Accelerate learning potential with:
 
* **Facilitate hybrid remote meetings** : With Team's meetings and extensibility options (learn more here), instructors can present to in-person and remote students seamlessly with all students having access to shared views, apps, and polls. For enhanced follow-up tasks, this also includes the option for multi-language transcription and audio/video course recordings. Teams and Moodle are game changers, working together to share roosters, activities, and tasks.

* **Personalize meeting panels and apps** : Developers use Teams Graph API endpoints to create unique collaborative learning experiences. Imagine your school has a special hackathon or initiative and you need to interview all freshman students. Why not using Teams channels and meetings to group students and categorize submissions using your own custom polls and quizzes sharable directly in Teams (desktop or mobile) while pushing updates to the Moodle portal asynchronously!

* **Automations and Workflow** : Set up automations for your institution. For example, every time a new student is added to a Moodle course, send an Adaptive Card to the student with relevant links and suggested reading optimize assimilation of key course materials. Or perhaps, you'd like to be sure to create a Moodle calendar event, every time a course meeting is scheduled? That will be easy to achieve with Teams plus a custom connector for Moodle.

* **Citizen Developer Apps** :  Open doorways to new custom apps as differentiators for your school. Simple apps that help to optimize learning can be created in days, and often in minutes! Envision for android with special event schedules, shuttle bookings, library books, mentors, etc. The sky is the limit as to what you can create to showcase value and/or to provide easy-to-use transact activities for students and teachers.
 
This is just a sample of what you can achieve by combining Microsoft Teams with your Moodle implementations! As you review this section on the Moodle LMS integrations, please do feel empowered to give us feedback, and to share your ideas for integrations below. We look forward to hearing from you as we continue to empower institutions worldwide to optimize learning and planning in education (learn more regarding Microsoft Education [here])(https://www.microsoft.com/education).

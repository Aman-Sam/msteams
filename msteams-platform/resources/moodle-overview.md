## Scenarios

The following scenarios provide examples of accelerated learning potential combining Microsoft's cloud services with Moodle's courses:

* **Facilitate hybrid remote meetings** : With Teams meetings and extensibility options, instructors can present in-person and remotely to students seamlessly. All students must have access to shared views, apps, and polls. For enhanced follow-up task, you must include the option for multi-language transcription and audio or video course recordings. Teams and Moodle are game changers, working together to share roosters, activities, and tasks. For more information, see (place holder for link).

* **Personalize meeting panels and apps** : You can use Teams Graph API endpoints to create unique collaborative learning experiences. For special initiatives in school such as, hackathon, the users can interview all freshman students by categorizing submissions using custom polls and share quizzes directly in Teams while pushing updates to the Moodle portal asynchronously.

* **Automations and workflow** : To set up automation for institution when a new student joins, the user can add Moodle course, send an Adaptive Card to the student with relevant links and suggest reading key course materials. With Teams along with custom connector for Moodle, the user can create a Moodle calendar event, every time a course meeting is scheduled.

* **Citizen developer apps** : Introduce new custom apps as differentiators for your school. Simple apps that help to optimize learning can be created in days, and often in hours. Envision for Teams with special event schedules, shuttle bookings, library books, mentors and various other services. The user can create to showcase value or to provide easy-to-use transactional activities for students and teachers.

These are few scenarios of combining Microsoft Teams with Moodle implementations. Please provide feedback, based on the section on the Moodle LMS integrations and share ideas for additional integrations. We look forward to hearing feedback as we continue to empower institutions worldwide to optimize learning and planning in education.

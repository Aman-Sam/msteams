# Overview

Media elements (e.g. audio/video clips) are supported in the AC SDK but not in Teams. This was originally de-scoped when moving Teams to AC v1.2 but we are looking to address now. There is no media support in Teams cards today (since we also don't support the audio/video/animation cards from Bot Framework), so there is no workaround. This will drive parity with the SDK (which already supports media elements) and would increase engagement with cards and bring new experiences to them.

# Media elements in Adaptive Cards

Adaptive Cards support media elements such as audio or video clips from OneDrive or SharePoint. To increase engagement with the Adaptive Cards and to provide new experience in the media elements, it uses OnePlayer to support the media play.

Adaptive Cards support the media elements without the force exit from Teams to view media. Teams donâ€™t provide any media support like audio, video, and animation cards from Bot Framework.

For desktop clients, Adaptive cards support inline and full screen playback and for mobile clients, the experience is limited to full screen and picture-in-picture (PiP) (allows you to watch video in floating window when you open the other apps).

Following are the different scenarios:

**LOB scenarios**

Video or audio files are directly uploaded to OneDrive or SharePoint and accessible within the tenant and Adaptive Cards plays the file through OnePlayer.

**Third party partner scenarios**

To improve the ability to deal with media files, following are the dynamic user-uploaded scenarios where users upload video or audio files within OneDrive or SharePoint in other tenants and be able to link to them:

* Files are directly uploaded to OneDrive or SharePoint external to the current tenant.
* Files are hidden behind external SSO or authentication. For example, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.

  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "version": "1.6",
  "fallbackText": "This card requires CaptionSource to be viewed. Ask your platform to update to Adaptive Cards v1.6 for this and more!",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "Media",
      "poster": "https://adaptivecards.io/content/poster-video.png",

    {
          "mimeType": "video/mp4",
          "url": "https://adaptivecardsblob.blob.core.windows.net/assets/AdaptiveCardsOverviewVideo.mp4"
    }
      ],
      "captionSources": [
      {

      "label": "English (vtt)",
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/5ac07e8adb8d7dcd7480973321e57d279d1f7d2c/assets/ProductVideoSubtitles.vtt"

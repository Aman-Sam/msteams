# People Picker in Adaptive Cards

This document describes how a People Picker can be added to your Adaptive Cards as an input control through which users can search for people in their Organization or within the context of the conversation that the card is sent in. 

To know more about Adaptive Cards, visit the [Cards Reference](cards-reference.md) section.

## Scenarios where People Picker in Adaptive Cards come handy

* **Approvals - Approver Reassignment Scenario**:  
Mary works in Sales at Contoso. She wanted to give a discount to Eric as he is a long time customer and she thinks the discount would help grow the relationship. She requested approval for a discount to Eric on their departmentâ€™s Teams Channel and added her manager Wendy as the approver.  
Wendy saw the request on the channel but realized this would need approval from someone senior and reassigned the approval request to Daniela. Daniela approves the request. 

* **Incident Management**:   
June works as a safety inspector at Kenya Port Authority who use an incident management app on Teams to track incidents. She recently noticed a fire hydrant not working properly and raised an issue for the same. Not knowing who the responsible point of contact for hydrants was, she tagged Ron, the head of the administration department.  
Ron saw the card and picked Vin and Reggie from the card itself and allocated the incident to them. 

* **Tech Support**:  
Here's another scenario where an employee is looking for support regarding an issue with VPN connectivity. The employee can use a Help bot to create a ticket for the issue which is then sent to a group with experts who can help with this issue.  
The initial card that is sent out would look like below:  
![People Picker Base Card](../../assets/images/cards/peoplepicker-base-card.png)  
The issue is initially unassigned. Experts in the group can view the card, understand the employee's issue and search for the right person to assign this to.  
![People Picker Search Experience](../../assets/images/cards/peoplepicker-card-search.png)  
On finding the right person to resolve this issue, clicking on the person's name in the search results would populate the picker control as follows:  
![People Picker Name Selected](../../assets/images/cards/peoplepicker-name-selected.png)  
Once selected, clicking on the Assign button would send this information back to the bot for further processing and notifying the selected person of the issue.  

## Overview

Given a set of `choices`, an [Input.ChoiceSet](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Input.ChoiceSet.html) control can be used in multiple forms like a dropdown, expanded single selection(radio buttons) or as a multi select control(check boxes) based on the `style` and `isMultiSelect` props.  

People Picker is implemented as an extension of the Input.ChoiceSet control.  

### Updates to the Input.ChoiceSet schema

The following are the new additions to the Input.ChoiceSet schema to enable a People Picker experience on the card.  

#### Input.Choiceset

|Property |Type |Required |Description |
|--|--|--|--|
|**choices.data** |**Data.Query** |No |Enables dynamic auto-complete as the user types, by fetching results from the dataset specified |

#### Data.Query

|Property |Type |Required |Description |
|--|--|--|--|
|**dataset** |string |Yes |The type of data that should be fetched dynamically|   

#### dataset
The following are the pre-defined values that can be provided as a **dataset** for people picker:   

|dataset|Search Scope
|--|--|
|**graph.microsoft.com/users** |Search all of the organization's members|
|**graph.microsoft.com/users?scope=currentContext** |Search within the members of the current conversation (chat/channel) in which the particular card is sent in|  

<br> 

> [!NOTE]
> Searching for all of the organization's members is currently only supported in 1:1 Chats with Bots, Adaptive Card Task Modules and Tabs. It is not supported in other 1:1 Chats, group chats or channels.  

### Usage
Here's a sample json for creating a People Picker with Org search enabled:

```json 
{
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "body": [
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "size": "Medium",
            "weight": "Bolder",
            "text": "People Picker with Org search enabled"
        },
        {
            "type": "Input.ChoiceSet",
            "choices": [],
            "choices.data": {
                "type": "Data.Query",
                "dataset": "graph.microsoft.com/users"
            },
            "id": "people-picker",
            "isMultiSelect": true
        },
        {
            "type": "ActionSet",
            "actions": [
                {
                    "type": "Action.Submit",
                    "title": "Submit"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "version": "1.2"
}
```  
![People Picker Org Search](../../assets/images/cards/peoplepicker-org-search.png)  
To enable searching within a conversation's member list, simply use the appropriate dataset defined in the table above. `isMultiSelect` property can be used to enable selecting multiple people in the control. By default, it is set to false and so allows selecting only one person.


#### Data Submission
Like every other Input control in Adaptive Cards, when a Submit Action is performed on the card, all the inputs provided in the card is sent back to the bot via an invoke. The invoke payload consists of a dictionary of input IDs to their corresponding values.  

In the case of People Picker, when a person is selected in the control, on submission, the `AAD ID` of the person is the value that is sent back. The `AAD ID` is a string(GUID) and uniquely identifies a user in a directory.

The format of the value submitted to the bot depends on the value of the `isMultiSelect` property:

|value of `isMultiSelect`|Format|
|--|--|
|false _(single select)_|The `AAD ID` of the selected user as a string|
|true _(multi select)_|A string composed of all the `AAD ID`s of the selected users concantenated with a 'comma'|  

#### Pre-Selection of People
People Picker supports pre-selection of people in the control when creating and sending an Adaptive Card.  
Input.ChoiceSet supports the `value` property which can be used to pre-select a person. The format of this `value` property is the same as the submitted value format discussed above.  
To pre-select a person in the control, specify the `AAD ID` of the person as the `value`. To pre-select multiple people (`isMultiSelect` should be _true_), specify a comma separated string of `AAD ID`s.

#### Static Choices
Input.ChoicSet supports specifying `choices` statically in the json. Generally, these are used to create the choices from which the user can pick.
<br><br>
Static `choices` can be used in conjunction with dynamic datasets. 
<br><br>
A choice basically consists of a `title` and a `value`. When used along with a People Picker, these choices are translated to people profiles which have the `title` as the name and `value` as the identifier. On searching, these custom profiles are also part of the results when the search query matches the given `title`.   
This enables developers to support scenarios where custom profiles need to be inserted into the pre-defined datasets.

## Mobile (iOS and Android)

People Picker is also supported on the iOS and Android clients along with the Web and Desktop client.   
While searching on the web involves an inline typing experience, tapping on a people picker on mobile launches a new experience from which a search can be performed. This search experience is similar to other people selection experience across mobile like adding a person to a chat/channel.

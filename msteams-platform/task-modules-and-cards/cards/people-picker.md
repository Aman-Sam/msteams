# People Picker in Adaptive Cards

You can add a People Picker as an input control to your Adaptive Card through which users can search for people and pick them. You can search for people within the context of the conversation, such as a chat, channel or an organization that the card is sent in. 

For more information on Adaptive Cards, see [Cards Reference](cards-reference.md).

## Advantages of People Picker in Adaptive Cards

The following examples show how the People Picker in Adaptive Cards is used in different scenarios:

* Approvals app of sales department to request, assign and reassign the approval to the intended people based on the requirement.
* Incident management app on Teams to track incidents and notify appropriate person for immediate action. 
* Technical support to resolve issues, such as VPN connectivity. In this case, the person can raise an issue ticket with a Help bot and send it to a group with experts who can help with this issue.

## Understand how People Picker works

The user can raise a ticket for VPN connectivity issue with a Help bot and send it to the appropriate group for resolution. People Picker helps selecting the intended receipient. The following image depicts the initial card sent out for VPN connectivity issue:

The issue is initially unassigned. Experts in the group can view the card, understand the employee's issue and search for the appropriate person to assign the issue. The following image depicts the issue assigned to the appropriate person:

After finding the correct person to resolve the issue, select the person's name in the search results. The selected name populates the picker control. The following image depicts the scenario:

After selecting the name, select **Assign**. This sends the information back to the bot to process further and notify the receipient of the issue.  

## Implement People Picker

People Picker is implemented as an extension of the [Input.ChoiceSet](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Input.ChoiceSet.html) control. The control includes the following:
* Dropdown, such as an expanded selection.
* Radio button, such as single selection.
* Check boxes, such as multiple selection.  
> [!NOTE]
> The `Input.ChoiceSet` control is based on the `style` and `isMultiSelect` properties.  

### Update schema

The following properties are the new additions to the `Input.ChoiceSet` schema to enable a People Picker experience on the card.  

#### Input.Choiceset control

|Property |Type |Required |Description |
|----|----|----|----|
|**choices.data** |**Data.Query** |No |Enables dynamic auto complete as the user types, by fetching results from the dataset specified. |

#### Data.Query

|Property |Type |Required |Description |
|--|--|--|--|
|**dataset** |string |Yes |The type of data that must be fetched dynamically.|   

#### dataset
The following predefined values are provided as a **dataset** for people picker:   

|dataset|Search Scope
|--|--|
|**graph.microsoft.com/users** |Search all of the organization's members.|
|**graph.microsoft.com/users?scope=currentContext** |Search within the members of the current conversation, such as chat or channel in which the particular card is sent in.|  

<br> 

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the search functionality for all the members across the organization is supported in 1:1 chats with bots, Adaptive Card task modules and tabs only. It is not supported in other 1:1 chats, group chats or channels.  

### Example
The code example for creating a People Picker with organization search is as follows:

```json 
{
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "body": [
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "size": "Medium",
            "weight": "Bolder",
            "text": "People Picker with Org search enabled"
        },
        {
            "type": "Input.ChoiceSet",
            "choices": [],
            "choices.data": {
                "type": "Data.Query",
                "dataset": "graph.microsoft.com/users"
            },
            "id": "people-picker",
            "isMultiSelect": true
        },
        {
            "type": "ActionSet",
            "actions": [
                {
                    "type": "Action.Submit",
                    "title": "Submit"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "version": "1.2"
}
```  

The following image depicts People Picker Adaptive Card with organization search:

>[!NOTE]
> To enable search within a conversation's member list, use the appropriate dataset defined in the [dataset](#dataset) table. `isMultiSelect` property is used to enable selecting multiple people in the control. It is set to false by default and allows to select one person only.

#### Data Submission
When a `Submit Action` is performed on the Adaptive Card, all the inputs provided in the card is sent back to the bot through an `invoke`. This `Submit Action` is similar to other `Input control` in Adaptive Cards. The `invoke` payload consists of a list of input IDs to their corresponding values.  

In People Picker, when a person is selected in the control, the `AAD ID` of the person is the value sent back. The `AAD ID` is a string and uniquely identifies a user in a directory.

The format of the value submitted to the bot depends on the value of the `isMultiSelect` property:

|value of `isMultiSelect`|Format|
|--|--|
|false _(single select)_|The `AAD ID` of the selected user as a string.|
|true _(multi select)_|A string composed of all the `AAD ID`s of the selected users concantenated with a 'comma'.|  

#### Preselection of People
People Picker supports preselection of people in the control when creating and sending an Adaptive Card.  
`Input.ChoiceSet` supports the `value` property which is used to preselect a person. The format of this `value` property is the same as the submitted value format discussed in data submission section.  
To preselect a person in the control, specify the `AAD ID` of the person as the `value`. To preselect multiple people, such as `isMultiSelect` is `true`, specify a comma separated string of `AAD ID`s.

#### Static Choices
The static choices support scenarios where custom profiles must be inserted into the predefined datasets.
`Input.ChoicSet` supports specifying `choices` statically in the json. Staticare used to create the choices from which the user can pick.
<br><br>
Static `choices` are used in conjunction with dynamic datasets. 
<br><br>
A choice basically consists of a `title` and a `value`. When used along with a People Picker, these choices are translated to people profiles which have the `title` as the name and `value` as the identifier. These custom profiles are also part of the search results when the search query matches the given `title`.   

## Mobile clients

People Picker is supported on the iOS and Android mobile clients. Selecting People Picker on mobile launches a new experience from which a search is performed. The search experience is similar to other people selection experience across mobile, such as adding a person to a chat or channel.

## Desktop clients
People Picker is supported in web and desktop client. While searching on the web involves an inline typing experience,

# Teams app that fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps that are provided by Microsoft or external services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensions or any combination of the three. Teams apps can be built to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App, too. These apps expand the value of your Teams collaborative experience.

Apps can be personal or shared. A personal app enables a one-on-one communication, and a shared app lets multiple users share app space to collaborate.

## Driving organizational goals

Collaboration and communication are key for an organization. Concise communication, integration with necessary services, and on-the-go accessibility is why organizations are increasingly choosing to rely on apps.

Organizations use it to connect with their customers, provide services, and share information. But that's not all! Apps are the meeting place for people to work together. A well-placed app helps build a cohesive environment for external and internal business needs.

- **Personal apps with tabs and bots**

    One-to-one conversational bots are one of the more open-ended features in Teams. The conversation is just between the bot and your user. You have the flexibility of including task modules to simplify complex sets of information.

    For example, if your app is a design tool with multiple collaborators, a shared bot that notifies all users helps to build user engagement.

    Additionally, a chat bot can be an easy replacement for emails and phone calls to IT or HR departments.

- **Surface existing app**

    If you've got an existing web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or other web-based application, it may make sense to enable some or all of it in Teams. Extending existing apps and porting interactive functionalities to Teams helps to grow user base and user engagement for your app.

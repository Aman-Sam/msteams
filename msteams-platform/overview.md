# Build apps for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather, learn, and work.

Apps are how you extend Teams to fit your needs. Create something brand new for Teams or integrate an existing app.

## What are Teams apps?

Teams apps are a combination of [capabilities](concepts/capabilities-overview.md). Some apps are simple (send notifications), while others are complex (manage patient records). When planning your app, remember that Teams is a collaboration hub. The best Teams apps help people express themselves and work better together.

### Personal apps

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::

**Help people focus**: A [personal app](concepts/design/personal-apps.md) is a dedicated space or bot to help users focus on their own tasks or view activities important to them.

   :::column-end:::

   :::column span="3":::

   :::column-end:::

:::row-end:::

### Tabs

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::

**Collaborate more conveniently**: Display your web-based content in a [tab](tabs/what-are-tabs.md) where people can discuss and work on it together.

   :::column-end:::

   :::column span="3":::

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/overview-channel-chat-apps-2021.png" alt-text="Conceptual representation of what tabs look like in the Teams client." border="false":::

   :::column-end:::

:::row-end:::

### Bots

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::

**Turn words into actions**: Conversations often result in the need to do something (generate an order, review my code, check ticket status, and so on). A [bot](bots/what-are-bots.md) can kick off these kinds of workflows right inside Teams.

   :::column-end:::

   :::column span="3":::

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/overview-bots-2021.png" alt-text="Conceptual representation of what bots look like in the Teams client." border="false":::

   :::column-end:::

:::row-end:::

### Messaging extensions

:::row:::

   :::column span="1":::

**Make it easier to multitask**: With [messaging extensions](messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions.md), you can quickly share external information in a conversation. You also can act on a message, such as creating a help ticket based on the content of a channel post.

   :::column-end:::

   :::column span="3":::

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/overview-messaging-extensions-2021.png" alt-text="Conceptual representation of what messaging extensions look like in the Teams client." border="false":::

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Meeting extensions

:::row:::

   :::column span="1":::

**Create apps for meetings**: There are a few options for [incorporating your app into the Teams calling experience](apps-in-teams-meetings/design/designing-apps-in-meetings.md).

   :::column-end:::

   :::column span="3":::

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/overview-meeting-extensions-2021.png" alt-text="Conceptual representation of what meeting extensions look like in the Teams client." border="false":::

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Webhooks and connectors

:::row:::

   :::column span="":::

**Communicate with external apps**: [Incoming webhooks](webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md#incoming-webhooks) are a simple way to automatically send notifications from another app to a Teams channel. With [outgoing webhooks](webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md#outgoing-webhooks), message your web service with an @mention.

   :::column-end:::

   :::column span="":::

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/overview-connectors.png" alt-text="Conceptual representation of what connectors look like in the Teams client." border="false":::

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Microsoft Graph for Teams

:::row:::

   :::column span="":::

**Utilize Teams data**: The [Microsoft Graph API for Teams](/graph/teams-concept-overview) provides access to information about teams, channels, users, and messages that can help you create or enhance features for your app (such as rich notifications).

   :::column-end:::

   :::column span="":::

## Integrate with Teams

Blend the features users love about an existing web app, service, or system with the collaborative features of Teams.

# Build your Teams app

Here’s how you proceed:

Select the section based on the type of Teams app you want to build:

If you’re new to building a Teams app, see [build a basic Teams app](#build-a-basic-teams-app)

If you’ve created Teams app, and want to build apps to suit a particular scenario, see [Scenario-based apps](#build-a-scenario-based-teams-app).

If you want to extend your Teams app across M365, see [Extend Teams app across M365](#extend-your-teams-app-across-microsoft-365).

## Build a basic Teams app

You can get started with building a Teams app with a basic tab app. The process to create the Teams app is similar for any basic app.

You can start by building a [basic tab app](../sbs-gs-javascript.yml).

For building other basic Teams app, see [Teams app tutorials and code samples](teams-toolkit-tutorial.md).

## Build a scenario-based Teams app

You can build a Teams app that is suitable for a particular scenario or use-case. For example, a notification bot is suitable to send notifications but not to chat.

You can start by building a [scenario-based app](../sbs-gs-notificationbot.yml)

For building other basic Teams app, see [Teams app tutorials and code samples](teams-toolkit-tutorial.md).

## Build message extension

You can build a message extension for your Teams app [build message extension](build-message-extension.md).

### Extend your Teams app across Microsoft 365

If you previously have built some Teams apps, now you can extend your apps across Microsoft 365 by updating the app manifest. Configure the properties in the Teams app manifest to make your app accessible over Outlook and Microsoft 365.

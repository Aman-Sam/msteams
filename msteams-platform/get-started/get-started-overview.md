# Build your first Teams app

Get started with building apps for Microsoft Teams and beyond!

Use GitHub Codespaces or walk through the step-by-step guide to build a basic, real-world Teams app. This module introduces you to common tools, fundamental concepts, and more advanced functionalities.

Here's an idea of what you'll learn:

* Get started quickly with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit.
* Build tab, scenario-based apps, and message extension with GitHub Codespaces or step-by-step guide.
* Learn about tutorials and code samples available for building your Teams app.
* Learn about various tools and SDKs available for building your Teams app.

## Choose your path

In this section, learn how to build a Teams app with different capabilities, such as tab, scenario-based bot app, and message extension.

1. Select the type of Teams app that you want to build:

   * **Build a basic Teams tab app**: Get started with building a Teams app with a basic tab app.

   * **Build a scenario-based Teams bot app**: Build a Teams app that is suitable for a particular scenario or use-case. For example, a notification bot is suitable for sending notifications but not to chat.

   * **Build message extension Teams app**: Build a search-based message extension Teams app.

2. Choose your path to build your selected app.

   * **GitHub Codespaces**: Allows you to run, test, and debug your app in a development environment without the need for any extra setup.
   * **Step-by-step guide**: Allows you to create a Teams app from the ground up including setting up your development environment.

## GitHub Codespaces

Before you create your codespace to build an app, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/) to create your codespace instance
* A [Microsoft 365 account](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) with custom app upload permission
* A [Microsoft 365 developer tenant](../concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md)

> [!TIP]
> [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) offers a free plan with a fixed amount of usage per month. If you reach the maximum number of allowed codespaces, go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) and delete codespaces that you don't need.

# [Message Extension](#tab/msgext1)

5. Once the app dialog appears, select **Add** to install your notification bot in Teams.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/get-started/codespace/bot-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the notification bot loaded in the Teams client.":::

6. Open a new terminal in your codespace and run the following command to trigger an event for sending a notification to your bot:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3978/api/notification
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > In real time, events are triggered by an external source, such as a third-party API that cause the notification bot to send the user a notification. To emulate an event trigger, you can send an event manually via curl commands on terminal.

   The notification bot app sends a notification as an Adaptive Card to your Teams client:

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/get-started/codespace/notification-bot.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the notification bot loaded in the Teams client.":::

   You successfully created the notification bot and loaded it in the Teams client.

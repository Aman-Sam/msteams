# Get started

Let's get started for building apps for Microsoft Teams and beyond!

Walk through the steps to build a basic, real-world Teams app. The Get started also introduces you to common tools, fundamental concepts, and more advanced features.

Here's an idea of what you learn:

* Get up and running quickly with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit (a Visual Studio Code extension).
* Learn to build apps with codespace.
* Learn to build scenario-based apps, such as a notification bot.
* Learn to build message extension.
* Learn to build different types of Teams apps with the help of tutorials and code samples.

## Choose your path to learn

In this section, learn more about your Teams app capabilities such as tab, scenerio-based app, and message extension. You can use one of the following ways to build your Teams app with different capabilities:

* GitHub Codespaces - Allows you to run, test, and debug your app as you used to do in a development environment without the need for any of the setup we're used to.
* Step by step guide - Allows you to create a Teams app from scratch with all development environment setup.

## App capabilities and development tools

(Note: will be moved to choose what suits you)

Based on the capabilities you want for your app, choose an appropriate development tool set.

| App capabilities | Tabs | Bots | Message extensions |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **User interactions** | A full-screen embedded web experience. | A chat bot that converses with members. | Shortcuts for inserting external content into a conversation or taking action on messages. |
| **Recommended tools** | Microsoft Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or TeamsFx CLI if you prefer using CLI | Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or TeamsFx CLI | Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or TeamsFx CLI |
| **SDKs** | TeamsFx SDK for core libs and Teams JavaScript client library for UI functionalities | TeamsFx SDK and Bot Framework SDK | TeamsFx SDK and Bot Framework SDK |
| **Technology stacks or Languages** | Web technology in general, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (incl. React). | Node.js, C#, Java, and Python. | Node.js, C#, Java, and Python. |

*You aren't limited to using these particular stacks!*

If you are already familiar with Yeoman workflow, you can use [YoTeams Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/pnp/generator-teams/blob/master/docs/docs/tutorials/build-your-first-microsoft-teams-app.md) to build your apps.

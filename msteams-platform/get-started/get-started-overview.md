# Get started

Let's get started with building apps for Microsoft Teams and beyond!

Experience the Teams app with Teams Toolkit codespaces or walk through the steps to build a basic, real-world Teams app. The Get started also introduces you to common tools, fundamental concepts, and more advanced functionalities.

Here's an idea of what you'll learn:

* Get up and running quickly with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit.
* Build apps with codespace.
* Build tab, scenario-based apps, and message extension with step-by-step guide.
* Learn about tutorials and code samples available for building your Teams app.
* Learn about various tools and SDKs available for building your Teams app.

## Build your first Teams app

Select the type of Teams app and choose your path to build it:

* **Build a basic Teams tab app**: You can get started with building a Teams app with a [basic tab app](build-basic-tab-app.md).

* **Build a scenario-based Teams bot app**: You can build a Teams app that is suitable for a particular scenario or use-case. For example, a [notification bot](build-notification-bot.md) is suitable to send notifications but not to chat.

* **Build message extension Teams app**: You can build a search based [message extension Teams app](build-message-extension.md).

### Choose your path to build your first Teams app

In this section, learn more about your Teams app capabilities, such as tab, scenario-based bot app, and message extension. You can use one of the following ways to build your Teams app:

* **Teams Toolkit codespaces**: Allows you to run, test, and debug your app in a development environment without the need for any of the setup.
* **Step by step guide**: Allows you to create a Teams app from scratch with all development environment setup.

## App capabilities and development tools

(Note: will be moved to choose what suits you)

Based on the capabilities you want for your app, choose an appropriate development tool set.

| App capabilities | Tabs | Bots | Message extensions |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **User interactions** | A full-screen embedded web experience. | A chat bot that converses with members. | Shortcuts for inserting external content into a conversation or taking action on messages. |
| **Recommended tools** | Microsoft Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or TeamsFx CLI if you prefer using CLI | Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or TeamsFx CLI | Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or TeamsFx CLI |
| **SDKs** | TeamsFx SDK for core libs and Teams JavaScript client library for UI functionalities | TeamsFx SDK and Bot Framework SDK | TeamsFx SDK and Bot Framework SDK |
| **Technology stacks or Languages** | Web technology in general, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (incl. React). | Node.js, C#, Java, and Python. | Node.js, C#, Java, and Python. |

*You aren't limited to using these particular stacks!*

If you are already familiar with Yeoman workflow, you can use [YoTeams Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/pnp/generator-teams/blob/master/docs/docs/tutorials/build-your-first-microsoft-teams-app.md) to build your apps.

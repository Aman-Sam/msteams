# Get started

Welcome to Get started for building and deploying customized apps for Microsoft Teams!

Walk through the steps to build a basic, real-world Teams app. The Get started also introduces you to common tools, fundamental concepts, and more advanced features.

Here's an idea of what you'll learn:

* Get up and running quickly with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit (a Visual Studio Code extension).
* Learn to build scenario-based apps, such as a notification bot.
* Get experience with the Toolkit and SDKs.
* Configure and build different types of Teams apps.
* Learn about extending your Teams app across Microsoft 365.

Let's take a quick glance at the build environment options you can choose from, and the road-map to build and deploy a Teams app.

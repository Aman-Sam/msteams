# Get started

Welcome to Get started for building and deploying customized apps for Microsoft Teams!

Walk through the steps to build a basic, real-world Teams app. The Get started also introduces you to common tools, fundamental concepts, and more advanced features.

Here's an idea of what you'll learn:

- Get up and running quickly with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit (a Visual Studio Code extension).
- Get experience with the Toolkit and SDKs.
- Configure and build different types of Teams apps.

Let's take a quick glance at the build environment options you can choose from, and the road-map to build and deploy a Teams app.

## App capabilities and development tools

Depending on the capabilities you want for your app, choose an appropriate development tool set.

| App capabilities | User interactions | Recommended tools | SDKs | Technology stacks / Languages |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Tabs | A full-screen embedded web experience. | Microsoft Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or [TeamsFx CLI](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/docs/cli/user-manual.md) if you prefer using CLI | [TeamsFx SDK](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teamsfx/?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) for core libs and [Teams client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) for UI functionalities | Web technology in general, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (incl. React). |
| Bots | A chat bot that converses with members. | Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or [TeamsFx CLI](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/docs/cli/user-manual.md) | [TeamsFx SDK](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teamsfx/?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) and [Bot Framework SDK](https://dev.botframework.com/) | Node.js, C#, Java, and Python. |
| Message extensions | Shortcuts for inserting external content into a conversation or taking action on messages. | Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit extension, or [TeamsFx CLI](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/docs/cli/user-manual.md) | [TeamsFx SDK](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teamsfx/?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) and [Bot Framework SDK](https://dev.botframework.com/) | Node.js, C#, Java, and Python. |

*You aren't limited to using these particular stacks!*

If you are already familiar with Yeoman workflow, you may prefer using [YoTeams Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/pnp/generator-teams/blob/master/docs/docs/tutorials/build-your-first-microsoft-teams-app.md) to build your apps.

## Build your first Teams app

Now, let's build your first Teams app. But first, pick your language (or framework) and prepare your development environment.

# Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create an app using React, Blazor, SPFx, C# or .NET, Node.js, and Yeoman Generator. You will also learn to create your first bot and messaging extension. This tutorial will take you through multiple Code Samples for Tabs, Bots, Messaging Extensions, Webhooks and Connectors, and Graph APIs that will help you to customize and configure your apps. In addition, you can also refer to the Microsoft Learn sections where you can extend the Teams developer platform capabilities by creating custom apps.

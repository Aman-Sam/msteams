# Get started developing apps for Microsoft Teams

[Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) is a service within Office 365. All users of Microsoft Teams can install apps from the Teams Store, but you will need to complete specific tasks to develop and test apps before they are ready for release to the Store.

You can think of Teams as a single page web application. Most of the content you see in Teams comes from the Office 365 servers that support your enterprise or [apps](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/apps) that integrate third-party services into the experience. This makes it easy for Teams to access other web-based content and display it in the Teams app. At their core, apps for Teams are like web services, hosted on third-party web servers.

Because of this, it is easy to publish and update apps, but it requires some planning before starting the app development. A key decision is where to host your app during development process, and how Teams will integrate with your app. You can host your app:

* On your local development machine
* Using a free service like glitch
* Using a public facing web server or Azure App Service

These options will be discussed in more detail later.

Here are some simple steps to create a Node.js Teams app and test it in Teams.

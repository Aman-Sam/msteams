# Get started developing for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is a service within Office 365. To get started developing extensions for Microsoft Teams, you'll first need an Office 365 commercial account, and you'll need to turn on the Microsoft Teams service for your Office 365 organization.

## 1. Set up your Office 365 tenant

To develop apps for Microsoft Teams, you need to be an [Office 365 customer with one of the following plans](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans).

* Business Essentials
* Business Premium
* Enterprise E1, E3, and E5
* Developer
* Education, Education Plus, and Education E5

Microsoft Teams will also be available to customers who purchased E4 prior to its retirement.

If you don't currently have an Office 365 account, you can sign up for the [Office 365 Developer program](https://dev.office.com/devprogram) to get a *free* one-year Office 365 Developer Tenant. This account should be used only for testing purposes.  See more information on [setting up your test accounts](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-users-individually-or-in-bulk-to-Office-365-Admin-Help-1970f7d6-03b5-442f-b385-5880b9c256ec?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

## 2. Turn on Microsoft Teams for your organization

>See general information on [administrator settings](https://support.office.com/article/Administrator-settings-for-Microsoft-Teams-3966a3f5-7e0f-4ea9-a402-41888f455ba2) for Microsoft Teams.

Teams is enabled by default in the versions of Office 365 that support it, however your Office 365 administrator might have disabled it. You can confirm that Teams is enabled for your organization by following these steps. Note that each user must have a valid license to access the product.

1. [Sign in to Office 365](https://portal.office.com) with your administrator account.
2. Select the **Admin** tile to go to the Office 365 Admin Center.
3. From **Settings**, select **Services & add-ins** or **Apps**.

* A GitHub account to create your codespace instance.
* A [Microsoft 365 account](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) with sideloading permission.
* A [Microsoft 365 tenant](../concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md)

To use codespaces for creating a Teams tab app:

1. Log into GitHub and open [GitHub codespaces for Teams](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Teams-Toolkit-for-Codespaces/33141593c9c97bdfb478c052f90345cbf226856a) The Teams Toolkit for Codespaces page appears.

# Build notification bot

The notification bot proactively sends messages in Teams channel or group chat or personal chat. You can trigger the notification bot with an HTTP request, such as cards or texts.

In this tutorial, get acquainted with a scenario-based Teams app in one of the following ways:

* Code spaces (external link)
* Step by step guide (Yaml file link)

## Use code spaces

Teams Toolkit Codespaces allows you to experience a Teams app in a few steps. You don’t need to install tools or go through the steps to create or build the app.  Before you use codespaces to use Teams Toolkit, ensure that you have:

* A GitHub account to create your codespace instance
* A [Microsoft 365 account](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) with sideloading permission
* A [Microsoft 365 tenant](../concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md)

To use codespaces for creating a Teams notification bot:

1. Log into GitHub and open [GitHub codespaces for Teams Toolkit](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Teams-Toolkit-for-Codespaces/33141593c9c97bdfb478c052f90345cbf226856a) The **Teams Toolkit for Codespaces** page appears.
1. Select Open in **GitHub codespaces** for Notification Bot. The Create codespace page appears for Teams notification bot.
1. Select **Create codespaces**. **The Setting up your codespace** page appears. Teams Toolkit prepares the app project for you and opens it in Visual Studio Code in the browser. Teams Toolkit icon appears in the activity bar of Visual Studio Code.
1. Select **Preview your Teams App (F5)** to build the app.
1. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account. Teams Toolkit codespaces builds the app. A dialog appears to prompt you to open the app in a browser.
1. Select the option to preview the app in the browser. The tab app is sideloaded to Teams and opens in the browser. The **Add app** dialog appears.
1. Select **Add**. The notification bot app is sideloaded to Teams and opens in the browser.

# Building for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather, learn, and work.

Apps are how you extend Teams to fit your needs. You can create something brand new for Teams or simply integrate features in your favorite apps and services.

## What can Teams apps do?

People discover and use Teams apps through a set of platform [capabilities](concepts/capabilities-overview.md).

Some apps are simple (send notifications), while others are complex (view patient records). When planning your app, remember that Teams is a collaboration hub. The best Teams apps help people express themselves and work better together.

### Get information more conveniently

Sometimes you just need to make things easier to find. Display an important webpage in a [tab](tabs/what-are-tabs.md), which provides a full-screen web experience for static and dynamic content in Teams.

### Share links without switching context

Pull information into a conversation and never leave Teams. For example, with [messaging extensions](messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions.md) you can share rich, easily digestible content from an external system using the message compose box.

### Turn words into actions

Conversations often result in the need to do something (create an order, review my code, etc.). A [bot](bots/what-are-bots.md) can kick off these kinds of workflows right inside Teams.

### Communicate with external apps and services

[Incoming webhooks](webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md#incoming-webhooks) are a simple way to automatically send alerts from another app to a Teams channel or chat. With [outgoing webhooks](webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md#outgoing-webhooks), you can send a message to your web service with an @mention.

### Utilize Teams data

The [Microsoft Graph REST API for Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-concept-overview) provides access to information about teams, channels, users, and messages that can help you create or enhance features for your app.

### No code, no worries

   You don't need to be a programmer to build a great app. Create a Teams app with little to no code using the Microsoft Power Platform.

# Prepare your development environment

If you are an Office 365 subscriber, you can develop apps for Microsoft Teams with one of the following [plans](https://products.office.com/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans):

* Business Essentials
* Business Premium
* Enterprise E1, E3, and E5
* Developer
* Education, Education Plus, and Education E5

Microsoft Teams will also be available to customers who subscribed to E4 prior to its [retirement](https://support.office.com//article/important-information-for-office-365-enterprise-e4-customers-f9572348-43a2-43fa-a3d8-3b6c9c042147).

## Just need a development environment?

If you don't currently have an Office 365 account, you can sign up for a [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) subscription. It's *free* for 90 days and will continually renew as long as you're using it for development activity. If you have a Visual Studio *Enterprise* or *Professional* subscription, both programs include a free Microsoft 365 [developer subscription](https://aka.ms/MyVisualStudioBenefits), active for the life of your Visual Studio subscription. *See* [Set up a Microsoft 365 developer subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/developer-program/office-365-developer-program-get-started).

## Enable Microsoft Teams for your organization

If Microsoft Teams has not been enabled for your organization, you'll need to do that first. Take a look at our detailed guidance for [enabling Teams for your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/enable-features-office-365).

## Enable custom Teams apps and turn on custom app uploading

Turn on custom app sideloading for your developer tenant as follows:

1. Login to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/homepage#/) with your admin credential. 

2. Select **Show All** --> **Teams**.

3. Navigate to **Teams apps** --> **Setup Policies** --> **Global(Org-wide default)**

4. Toggle **upload custom apps** to the **on** position.

That's it! Your test tenant will now allow custom app sideloading.

> [!Note] 
> It can take up to 24 hours before sideloading is enabled. During interim, you can use **upload for \<your tenant>** to test your app.

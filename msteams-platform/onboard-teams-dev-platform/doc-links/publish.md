# Understanding the AppSource submission process

## Teams app submission

Publishing  your app to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) makes it available in the Teams app catalog and on the web. At a high level, the process for submitting your app to AppSource is:

1. Develop your app following our [design guidelines](~/concepts/design/understand-use-cases.md). Tabs should follow our [tab design guidelines](~/tabs/design/tabs.md). Bots should follow the [bot design guidelines](~/bots/design/bots.md).
1. Ensure your app meets the app [validation policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies) for Microsoft Teams.
1. [Set up a developer account](/office/dev/store/open-a-developer-account) in [Partner Center](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4499930/partner-center-overview). *See also* [How do I create a Partner Center account](#how-do-i-create-a-partner-center-account) in the FAQ section, below.
1. Prepare your app for submission by following our [submission checklist](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/submission-checklist.md).
1. Review our [tips for a successful app submission](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/frequently-failed-cases.md).
1. Submit your package to [AppSource through Partner Center](/office/dev/store/use-partner-center-to-submit-to-appsource).
1. Track the approval process on your Partner Center dashboard. *See* [Partner Center Overview](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4499930/partner-center-overview).
1. Post submission — review our guidance for [Maintaining and supporting your published app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/post-publish/overview.md).

>[!NOTE]

During the account verification process the status of each required step —  Email Ownership, Employment Verification, and Business Verification — will be displayed. Once the verification process has been successfully completed, the verification status of your enrollment on the profile page will change from "pending" to "authorized," and the process steps will no longer be displayed.

## My account Verification status has not advanced beyond Email Ownership. How should I proceed?

During the **Email Ownership** verification process, a verification email is sent to the primary contact email address. Please check your primary contact inbox for an email  from **maccount@<span>microsoft</span>.com** with the subject  line *Action needed: Verify your email account with Microsoft*, requesting that you complete the email verification process. The verification email will be sent to the email address listed  in your account settings page in Partner Center.

> [!NOTE]
 >The email verification link is only valid for 7 days. You can request that we resend the email to you by visiting your partner profile page and selecting the **Resend verification email** link. To ensure that the email is received, whitelist email from microsoft.com as a safe domain, and check your junk email folders.

## How I do get further support for my account related issues?

Please visit our [Support for the Commercial Marketplace program in Partner Center](/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/support) page for guidance and steps to create a support ticket.

Please try the following:

1. Check your junk/spam folder.

1. Try accessing the  **Resend verification email** link  from a different browser.
1. Work with your IT department to ensure that the verification emails are not blocked by the email server.
1. Adjust your server's spam filter to allow/whitelist all emails from **maccount@microsoft.<span></span>com**.

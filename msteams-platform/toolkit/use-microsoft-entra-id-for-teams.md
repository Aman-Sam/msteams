# Use Microsoft Entra ID for Teams apps

Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud platform that simplifies the process of building Teams apps. You can host your Teams apps entirely in Microsoft Entra ID or extend your app with Azure services. Hosting your Teams app on Microsoft Entra ID helps you create apps that are reliable, scalable, and easily maintainable. Microsoft Entra ID supports popular programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET, and Go.

You must have an Azure account to use Azure resources or to host your Teams app on Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Microsoft Entra ID subscription](/azure/developer/intro/azure-developer-billing#what-is-an-azure-subscription).

You can host any Teams app on Microsoft Entra ID with any capability or use the following services for your Teams app:

1. Teams apps for meetings:
    1. [Generate meeting token for Teams](../sbs-meeting-token-generator.yml)
    1. [Generate Teams meeting side panel](../sbs-meetings-sidepanel.yml)

1. Teams bot apps:
    1. Create client secret for the bot app
    1. Authentication for Teams apps
    1. [Configure Single sign-on for your app](add-single-sign-on.md)
    1. [Configure third-party authentication for your app](../tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-tab-aad.md)
    1. [Send activity feed notification from Microsoft Teams activity feed](../sbs-graphactivity-feedbroadcast.yml)

Microsoft Entra ID also enables you to customize who has access to your account when you're registering your Teams app on the platform.

| **Account type** | **Tenant type** | **Function** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts in this organizational directory only | Single tenant | All users and guest accounts in your directory can use Teams your app. Use this option if your target audience is internal to your organization. |
| Accounts in any organizational directory | Multitenant | All users with a work or school account from Microsoft can use your Teams app. It includes schools and businesses that use Microsoft 365. Use this option if you want to enable multitenancy and your target audience are businesses or educational customers. |
| Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts | Multitenant | All users with a work or school, or personal Microsoft account can use your Teams app. It includes schools and businesses that use Microsoft 365 as well as personal accounts that are used to sign in to services like Xbox and Skype. Use this option to enable multitenancy and target the widest set of Microsoft identities. |
| Personal Microsoft accounts only | NA | Personal accounts that are used to sign in to services like Xbox and Skype. Use this option to target the widest set of Microsoft identities. |

## Tenants in Microsoft Entra ID

A 'tenant' is a secure identity and access management system for the Teams apps that you host in Microsoft Entra ID. It also contains the users, groups, and other apps stored in the organizationâ€™s Azure environment. The tenant provides a centralized platform for admins to manage identities, permissions, and access to Azure resources and services.

A single tenant app in Microsoft Entra ID is restricted to the users in the organizational directory it's created in. This type of tenant is suited for apps that are simple and prioritize security, privacy, and collaboration within an organization. On the other hand, multitenant apps are accessible to users both inside and outside the tenant it's created in. This type of tenancy promotes better scalability, reach, and collaboration within and across organizations.

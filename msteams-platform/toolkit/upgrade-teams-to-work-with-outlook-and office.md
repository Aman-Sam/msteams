# Upgrade Teams Application to Work with Outlook and Office.com

Teams Toolkit offers helpers for Visual Studio Code developers to upgrade Teams applications (Tab application) to work with Outlook and Office. The feature helps upgrade the manifest and `TeamsJS` SDK to the latest version so that the application can run on Outlook and Office.com.

## Prerequisite

Install the latest version of Teams Toolkit from Visual Studio Code extension marketplace: [Teams Toolkit (Preview) - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

## Upgrade Manifest and SDK

In Visual Studio Code, open the command palette and find following commands:

* Teams: Upgrade Teams Manifest to Work in Outlook and Office
* Teams: Upgrade Teams Tab App to Work in Outlook and Office

### Upgrade Manifest

Run the command `Teams: Upgrade Teams Manifest to Work in Outlook and Office` and select your Teams Tab App manifest file to migrate:

1. Update manifest version to `m365DevPreview`.
1. Update manifest file to use the latest `DevPreview` schema.

### Upgrade Custom Tab

Run the command `Teams: Upgrade Teams Tab App to Work in Outlook and Office` and select your Teams Tab App project to migrate:

1. Update Teams JS SDK to the latest beta version.
1. Update function references, Enum and interface references.
1. Add `TODO` comments to finish changing callbacks to promises manually.

[!Note]
> changing from callbacks to promises alters control flow and cannot be fully automated. This code will have `TODO` comments for developers review. The typical solution is to make parent function `async` and use `await` next to each promise.

1. Add `TODO` in places where developers may be impacted by changes to the context schema.

[!Note]
> transforming JavaScript inline within HTML is not supported.

## Run  your Teams application in Outlook and Office.com

After upgrading your Teams application, you should be able to run them in Outlook and Office.com.

# Deploy to the cloud

Teams Toolkit helps you to deploy or upload the backend and frontend code in your application to your provisioned cloud resources in Azure.

* The backend Azure functions if configured, can use different kinds of Azure services, including Azure App service and Azure storage.
* The frontend applications are deployed to an Azure storage account and configured for static web hosting or a SharePoint site.

## Prerequisite

- [Install Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) version v3.0.0+.
- Before deploy project code to cloud, you must perform the [Provision cloud resources](provision.md) steps first.
 
## Deploy Teams apps using Teams Toolkit

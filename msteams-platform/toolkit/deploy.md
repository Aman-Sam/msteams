# Deploy to the cloud

Teams Toolkit helps you to deploy or upload the frontend and backend code in your application to your provisioned cloud resources in Azure.

* The Tab, such as frontend applications are deployed to Azure storage and configured for static web hosting or a SharePoint site.
* The backend APIs are deployed to Azure Functions.
* The Bot or Messaging Extension is deployed to Azure App Service.

## Prerequisite

* [Install Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) version v3.0.0+.

> [!TIP]
> You should already have a Teams app project opened in VS code.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you deploy project code to cloud, perform the [provision cloud resources](provision.md) steps first.

# Debug your Teams app locally in Teams Toolkit

Teams Toolkit helps you to debug and preview your Teams app locally. Debug is the process of checking, detecting, and correcting issues or bugs to ensure that the program runs as per the requirements. Visual Studio Code allows you to debug tab, bot, messaging extension, and Azure functions. Toolkit supports debugging features including start, multi-target debugging, toggle breakpoints, hot reloading, and stop. The Teams app is available for preview in Teams web client locally after the debugging process. 

## Prerequisite

Install [Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) version v3.0.0+ or later.


## Visual Studio Code debugging features

### Start debugging

When you start local debug, you can select **Start** in the floating debugging toolbar to start all debug sessions.

### Toggle breakpoints

In Visual Studio Code, you canÂ toggle breakpoints on the source codes of tabs, bots, messaging extensions, and Azure functions. The breakpoints execute when you interact with the Teams app in a web browser. The following image shows the toggle breakpoints:

### Hot reload

You can update the source codes of tab, bot, messaging extension, and Azure functions at the same time when you are debugging the Teams app. Update the code and save the changes. The project re-loads and the debugger re-attaches to the programming languages.

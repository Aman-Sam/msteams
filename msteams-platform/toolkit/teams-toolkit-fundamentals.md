# Teams Toolkit Overview

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, this feature is available in **public developer preview** only.

Teams Toolkit lets you create, debug, and deploy your Teams app right from Visual Studio Code. App development with the toolkit has the advantages of:

- Integrated identity
- Access to cloud storage
- Data from Microsoft Graph
- Azure and Microsoft 365 services with zero-configuration approach

Teams Toolkit brings all tools needed for building a Teams app in one place.

For Teams app development, similar to Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, you can use [CLI tool](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/docs/cli/user-manual.md), which consists of Toolkit `teamsfx`.

## Features

### Project templates

Teams Toolkit reduces the complexity of getting started with templates for common line-of-business app scenarios and smart defaults to accelerate your time to production. If you're already familiar with Teams app development, you can also start directly with capability-focused templates. i.e. Tab, Bot, Messaging Extension.

### Automatic registration and configuration

Save time and let the toolkit automatically register the app in Teams Developer Portal and configure settings like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) automatically when you first run or debug the app. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account to control where the app is configured and customize the included Azure AD manifest when you need flexibility.

### Multiple environments

With the environments features, you can create different groupings of cloud resources to make it simpler to run and test your app. Use the "dev" environment with your Azure subscription or create a new app with a different subscription for staging, test, and production.

### Quick access to Teams Developer Portal

Quickly access Teams Developer Portal, where you can configure, distribute, and manage your app. For more information, seeâ€¯[manage your Teams apps using Developer Portal](../concepts/build-and-test/manage-your-apps-in-developer-portal.md).

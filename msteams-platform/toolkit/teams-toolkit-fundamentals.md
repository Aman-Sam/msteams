# Teams Toolkit

The Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code helps developers create and deploy Teams apps with integrated identity, access to cloud storage, data from Microsoft Graph, and other services in Azure and M365 with a zero-configuration approach to the developer experience.  

There is a Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio and a [CLI tool](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/docs/cli/user-manual.md) for Teams app development (called `teamsfx`).

## Install the Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

1. Open **Visual Studio Code.**

1. Select the Extensions view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).

1. In the search box, enter _Teams Toolkit_.

1. Select install button next to the Teams Toolkit.

You can find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

If you are using Linux (including WSL), you must install the following tools:

- [Azure Functions Core Tools](/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)

Azure Functions Core Tools is used to run backend components locally during a local debug run, authentication is required when running your services in Azure and installed within the project directory using the npm `devDependencies`.

- [.NET SDK](/dotnet/core/install/)

The .NET SDK is used to install customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. If you have not installed the .NET 3.1 or later SDK globally, the portable version is installed.

- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)

The Teams app features like conversational bots, messaging extensions, and incoming webhooks require inbound connections. A tunnel is not required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`).

## Supported Teams Apps Capabilities

[Understand Microsoft Teams app capabilities](../concepts/capabilities-overview.md) are Teams extensibility points. Your Teams app can contain one or more Teams App Capabilities. Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code supports developers to work on project with the following Teams App Capabilities:

* [Tabs](../tabs/what-are-tabs.md#microsoft-teams-tabs)

* [Bots](../bots/what-are-bots.md#bots-in-microsoft-teams)

* [Messaging extensions](../messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions.md#messaging-extensions)

Your Teams project can contain either one of the capabilities or all three capabilities from above.

You can select any capability when you create the Teams Project.

Teams Toolkit provides flexibility to add more capabilities in further process of Teams app development.

## Take a Tour of Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

In left sidebar of Teams Toolkit, there are four sections that offers the main features.

### Typical User Journey of Teams Toolkit
Teams Toolkit provides features of Teams app development to make it easy to debug, deploy and publish. Teams Toolkit automates manual work and provides great integration of Teams and Azure resources. The following picture shows Teams Toolkit user journey:

![Teams Toolkit journey](~/assets/images/tools-and-sdks/teams-toolkit-user-journey.png)

### ACCOUNTS

Developers must have a Microsoft 365 account before they start to build Teams app. If you do not have, you can get a free Teams developer account by joining the M365 developer program. A good practice is to verify whether your Microsoft 365 account has the permission to upload Teams app before you start the Teams app building. In Teams client, select `Apps`. If you cannot see the `Upload custom app` option, you do not have the permission to upload your Teams app.

![Teams Toolkit accounts](~/assets/images/tools-and-sdks/Teams-Toolkit-Accounts.png)

![Upload custom app](~/assets/images/tools-and-sdks/upload-custom-app-closeup.png)

Please contact your tenant administrator to [Prepare your Microsoft 365 tenant](../concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md). If you don't get permission from tenant administrator, you can join M365 developer program.

Azure account is commonly used in Teams app development. If you wish to host your Teams app or access resources on Azure, you must have an Azure account. Teams Toolkit support integrated experience to sign in, provision and deployment for Azure resources. You can [create a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you start.

For more information about Accounts, please check the [Require accounts with valid subscription to create apps](teams-toolkit-account.md).

### DEVELOPMENT

Teams Toolkit provides options in the `DEVELOPMENT` section to help you make the Teams app development work easily and quickly.  

![Development](~/assets/images/tools-and-sdks/Teams-Toolkit-Development.png)

1. `Create a new Teams app` lets you to start Teams app development work with either a ""hello world" template project or a sample project.
1. Select 'create a new Teams app', specify the Teams app capabilities and other parameters, Teams Toolkit will generate a "hello world" app template for you to start with.
1. Select 'start from a sample', Teams Toolkit will download and open the source code of selected samples.
1. There are a set of samples for you to explore, reference and start development work with. By clicking `View samples` you can see samples and download.
1. `Add capabilities` lets you to add additional Teams capabilities to Teams app at any time during development process.
1. `Add cloud resources` lets you to add additional cloud resources according to the requirement change.
1. You can use debug feature by clicking the `Run and Debug` button. Teams Toolkit support local debug and remote debug for Teams projects. Before running remote debug, you must provision cloud resource first.
1. `Edit manifest file` lets you to easily edit how the Teams app integrate with Teams client.  

### DEPLOYMENT

During or after the development, you must do provision, deployment and publish process before it is accessed by real users. These are accomplished by using a set of options in `DEPLOYMENT` section.

![Deployment](~/assets/images/tools-and-sdks/Teams-Toolkit-Deployment.png)

1. If you want to host your Teams app on Azure or you need to use Azure resources, `Provision in the cloud` helps you automate the process to create Azure resources. To use it you must have an Azure Subscription which you can use to provision new resources.

1. `Validate manifest file` helps you to check whether the manifest file is valid and has manifest schema.

1. Before publishing your app or share it with someone else, you can build your Teams app into packages by clicking `Zip Teams metadata package`.

1. `Deploy to the cloud` helps you to deploy their source code to Azure. The prerequisite to run deploy is you have provisioned resources by running `Provision in the cloud` or you have to create the Azure resources manually and specify the resource parameter in your project environment settings. 

For more information about provision and deploy, see [Provision in the cloud](provision-in-the-cloud.md) and [Deploy to the cloud](deploy-to-the-cloud.md).

1. Instead of manually publishing your custom Teams app, you can use `Publish to Teams` function to call Teams api to publish Teams app. You need the permission to upload Teams app. For more information refer to [Accounts](placeholder, point to Accounts page).

1. Developer Portal for Teams is where you can manage and distribute your Teams app.  

1. Teams Toolkit also provides CI/CD template for CI/CD tools like GitHub Workflow, Azure DevOps and Jenkins. For tools on how to build CI/CD pipeline, see [Build CI/CD pipelines for Teams application](build-pipelines.md)

### HELP AND FEEDBACK

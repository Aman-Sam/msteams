Teams Toolkit support integrated experience to sign in, provision and deployment for Azure resources. You can [create a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you start.

## Environment

Teams Toolkit helps you to create and manage multiple environments, provision, and deploy artifacts to the target environment for Teams App.

### TeamsFx Collaboration

It allows developers and project owner to invite other collaborators to the TeamsFx project to debug, provision, and deploy the same TeamsFx project.

## Development

Teams Toolkit helps you to create and customize your Teams app project that makes the Teams app development work simpler.

### Create a new Teams app

It helps you to start with Teams app development by creating new Teams project using Teams Toolkit either by using **Create new project** or **Create from samples**.

## Deployment

During or after the development, ensure to provision, deploy, and publish Teams app before it is accessible to users.

### Provision in the cloud

It integrates with Azure resource manager that enables you to provision Azure resources, which your application needs for code approach.

### Deploy to the cloud

 It helps you to deploy the source code to Azure.

### Publish to Teams

After creating the app, you can distribute your app to different scope, such as individual, team, organization, or anyone. Publish to Teams helps you to publish your developed app.

### CI/CD guide

It helps to automate your development workflow while building Teams application. CI/CD guide provides tools and templates for you to get started while setting up CI or CD pipelines.

#### TeamsFx CLI

TeamsFx CLI is a text-based command line interface that accelerates Teams application development and also enables CI/CD scenario where you can integrate CLI in scripts for automation.

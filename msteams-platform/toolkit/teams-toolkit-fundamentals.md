Teams Toolkit makes it simple to get started with app development for Microsoft Teams using Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.

* Start with a project template or from a sample
* Save setup time with automated app registration and configuration
* Run and debug to Teams directly from familiar tools
* Smart defaults for hosting in Azure using infrastructure-as-code and Bicep
* Create unique configurations like dev, test, and prod using the Environments feature
* Bring your app to your organization or the Teams App Store using built-in publishing tools

## Available for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code

Teams Toolkit is available for free for Visual Studio Code and supports Visual Studio 2022 Community, Professional, and Enterprise. Visit the [Install Teams Toolkit documentation](./install-Teams-Toolkit.md) for more information about installation and setup.

## Features

### Project templates

Teams Toolkit reduces the complexity of getting started with templates for common line-of-business app scenarios and smart defaults to accelerate your time to production. If you're already familiar with Teams app development, you can also start directly with capability-focused templates. i.e. Tab, Bot, Messaging Extension.

### Automatic registration and configuration

Save time and let the toolkit automatically register the app in Teams Developer Portal and configure settings like Azure Active Directory automatically when you first run or debug the app. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account to control where the app is configured and customize the included Azure AD manifest when you need more flexibility.

### Multiple environments

With the Environments features, you can create different groupings of cloud resources to make it simpler to run and test your app. Use the "dev" environment with your Azure subscription or create a new one with a different subscription for staging, test, and production.

### Quick access to Teams Developer Portal

Quickly access Teams Developer Portal, where you can configure, distribute, and manage your app. For more information, seeâ€¯[manage your Teams apps using Developer Portal](../concepts/build-and-test/manage-your-apps-in-developer-portal.md).

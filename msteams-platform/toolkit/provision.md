# Provision cloud resources using Teams Toolkit

TeamsFx integrates with Azure and Microsoft 365 cloud, which allows you to place your application in Azure with a single command. TeamsFx integrates with Azure Resource Manager that enables you to provision Azure resources, which your application needs for code approach.

## Provision using Teams Toolkit

Provision is performed with single command in Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code or TeamsFx CLI. For more information, see [Provision Azure-based app](/microsoftteams/platform/sbs-gs-javascript?tabs=vscode%2Cvsc%2Cviscode%2Cvcode&tutorial-step=8)

## Create Resources

When you trigger provision command in Teams Toolkit or TeamsFx CLI, you can get the following resources:

* Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application under your Microsoft 365 tenant.
* Teams app registration under your Microsoft 365 tenant's Teams platform.
* Azure resources under your selected Azure subscription.

When you create a new project, you can use all the Azure resources. The ARM template defines all the Azure resources and helps to create required Azure resources during provision. When you [add new capability resource](./add-resource.md) to an existing project, the updated ARM template reflects the latest change.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure services incur costs in your subscription, for more information on cost estimation, see [the pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

The following list shows the resource creation for different types of app and Azure resources:

## Customize resource provision

Teams Toolkit enables you to use an infrastructure-as-code approach to define Azure resources that you want to provision, and how you want to configure. The tool uses ARM template to define Azure resources. The ARM template is a set of bicep files that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. You can customize Azure resources by modifying the ARM template. For more information, see [bicep document](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep).

Provision with ARM involves changing the following sets of files, parameters and templates:

* ARM parameter files (`azure.parameters.{your_env_name}.json`) located at `.fx/configs` folder, for passing parameters to templates.
* ARM template files located at `templates/azure`, this folder contains following files:

| File | Function | Allow customization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| main.bicep | Provide entry point for Azure resource provision | Yes |
| provision.bicep | Create and configure Azure resources | Yes |
| config.bicep | Add TeamsFx required configurations to Azure resources | Yes |
| provision/xxx.bicep | Create and configure each Azure resource consumed by `provision.bicep` | Yes |
| teamsfx/xxx.bicep | Add TeamsFx required configurations to each Azure resource consumed by `config.bicep`| No |

> [!NOTE]
> When you add resources or capabilities to your project, `teamsfx/xxx.bicep` will be regenerated, you can't customize the same. To modify the bicep files, you can use Git to track your changes to `teamsfx/xxx.bicep` files, which helps you to not lose changes while adding resources or capabilities.

### Azure AD parameters

The ARM template files use placeholders for parameters. The purpose of these placeholders is to ensure creation of new resources for you in new environment. The actual values are resolved from `.fx/states/state.{env}.json`.

There are two types of parameters such as Azure AD application related parameters and Azure resource-related parameters.

##### Azure AD application-related parameters

| Parameter name | Default value place holder | Meaning of the place holder | How to customize |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft 365 ClientId | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.clientId}} | Your app's Azure AD app client id created during provision | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot) |
| Microsoft 365 ClientSecret | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.clientSecret}} | Your app's Azure AD app client secret created during provision | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app) |
| Microsoft 365 TenantId | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.tenantId}} | Tenant Id of your app's Azure AD app | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app)  |
| Microsoft 365 OAuthAuthorityHost | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.oauthHost}} | OAuth authority host of your app's Azure AD app | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app) |
| botAadAppClientId | {{state.fx-resource-bot.botId}} | Bot's Azure AD app client Id created during provision | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot) |
| botAadAppClientSecret | {{state.fx-resource-bot.botPassword}} | Bot's Azure AD app client secret created during provision | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot) |

##### Azure resource-related parameters

| Parameter name | Default value place holder | Meaning of the place holder | How to customize |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| azureSqlAdmin | {{state.fx-resource-azure-sql.admin}} | Azure SQL Server admin account you provided during provision | Delete the placeholder and fill the actual value |
| azureSqlAdminPassword | {{state.fx-resource-azure-sql.adminPassword}} | Azure SQL Server admin password you provided during provision | Delete the placeholder and fill the actual value |

#### Referencing environment variables in parameter files

If you don't want to hardcode the values in parameter files, for example, when the value is a secret. The parameter files support referencing the values from environment variables. You can use syntax `{{$env.YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}}` in parameter values for the tool to resolve from current environment variable.

The following example reads the value of `mySelfHostedDbConnectionString` parameter from environment variable `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`:

```json
...
    "mySelfHostedDbConnectionString": "{{$env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING}}"
...
```

#### Customize ARM template files

If the predefined templates doesn't meet your application requirement, you can customize the ARM templates under `templates/azure` folder. For example, you can customize the ARM template to create some additional Azure resources for your app. You need to have basic knowledge of bicep language, which is used to author ARM template. You can get started with bicep at [bicep documentation](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/).

> [!NOTE]
> The ARM template is shared by all environments. You can use [conditional deployment](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/conditional-resource-deployment) if the provision behavior varies between environments.

To ensure the TeamsFx tool functions properly, ensure you customize ARM template, which satisfies the following requirement. If you use other tool for further development, you can ignore these requirements.

* Keep the folder structure and file name unchanged. The tool may append new content to existing files when you add more resources or capabilities to your project.
* Keep the name of auto-generated parameters as well as its property names unchanged. The auto-generated parameters may be used when you add more resources or capabilities to your project.
* Keep the output of auto-generated ARM template unchanged. You can add additional outputs to ARM template. The output is `.fx/states/state.{env}.json` and can be used in other features such as deploy, validate manifest file.

### Customization scenarios

You can customize the following scenarios:

#### Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot

You can add following configuration snippet to `.fx/configs/config.{env}.json` file to use an Azure AD app created by yourself for your Teams app. To create an Azure AD app, see <https://aka.ms/teamsfx-existing-aad-doc>.

```json
"auth": {
    "clientId": "<your Azure AD app client id>",
    "clientSecret": "{{$env.ENV_NAME_THAT_STORES_YOUR_SECRET}}",
    "objectId": "<your Azure AD app object id>",
    "accessAsUserScopeId": "<id of the access_as_user scope>"
}
```

After adding the snippet, add your secret to related environment variable so the tool can resolve the actual secret during provision.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure not to share the same Azure AD app in multiple environments. If you don't have permission to update the Azure AD app, you can get a warning with instructions about how to manually update the Azure AD app. Follow the instructions to update your Azure AD app after provision.

#### Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app

You can add following configuration snippet to `.fx/configs/config.{env}.json` file to use an Azure AD app created by yourself for your bot:

```json
"bot": {
    "appId": "<your Azure AD app client id>",
    "appPassword": "{{$env.ENV_NAME_THAT_STORES_YOUR_SECRET}}"
}
```

After adding the preceding snippet, add your secret to related environment variable for the tool to resolve the actual secret during provision.

#### Skip adding user for SQL database

If you have insufficient permission error when the tool tries to add user to SQL database, you can add the following configuration snippet to `.fx/configs/config.{env}.json` file to skip adding SQL database user:

```json
"skipAddingSqlUser": true
```

### Specifying the name of Function App instance

You can use `contosoteamsappapi` for function app instance instead of using the default name.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already provisioned the environment, specifying the name can create a new function app instance for you, instead of renaming the instance created previously.

The following steps are:

1. Open `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.{env}.json` for your current environment.
2. Add a new property, for example, `functionAppName` under the `provisionParameters` section.
3. Enter a value of `functionAppName`, for example `contosoteamsappapi`.
4. Final parameter file is shown in the following snippet:

    ```json
    {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {
            "provisionParameters": {
            "value": {
                "functionAppName": "contosoteamsappapi"
                ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

To add other Azure resource or storage to the application:

Consider the following scenario:

You want to add Azure storage to your Azure function backend to store blob data. There is no auto flow to update the bicep template with Azure storage support. However, you can edit the bicep file and add the resource. The steps are as follows:

1. Create a tab project.
2. Add function to the project. For more information, see [add resources](./add-resource.md).
3. Declare the new storage account in ARM template. You can declare the resource at `templates/azure/provision/function.bicep` directly. You're free to declare the resources in other places.

    `````````bicep
    var applicationStorageAccountName = 'myapp${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
    resource applicationStorageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-06-01' = {
        name: applicationStorageAccountName
        location: resourceGroup().location
        kind: 'Storage'
        sku: {
            name: 'Standard_LRS'
        }
    }
    `````````

4. Update the Azure function app settings with Azure storage connection string in `templates/azure/provision/function.bicep`. Add the following snippet to `functionApp` resource's `appSettings` array:

    ``````````````````bicep
    {
        name: 'MyAppStorageAccountConnectionString'
        value: 'DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=${applicationStorageAccount.name};AccountKey=${listKeys(applicationStorageAccount.id, '2021-06-01').keys[0].value}'
    }
    ```````````````````

5. You can update your function with Azure storage output bindings.

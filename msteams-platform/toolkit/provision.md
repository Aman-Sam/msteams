# Use Teams Toolkit to provision cloud resources

TeamsFx provides integration with Azure and Microsoft 365 cloud. You can place your application in Azure. In this step, necessary cloud resources are created in Azure and Microsoft 365 for your application.

> Note: This document applies to VS Code Teams Toolkit extension 3.0 / TeamsFx CLI 0.8.0 or higher.
> TODO: Double confirm the tooling version, or delete above note.

## Prerequisites

1. Account prerequisites

    To provision cloud resources in Azure and Microsoft 365, you must have the following accounts with proper permissions. Refer to [Prepare accounts to build Teams app](accounts.md) for more information.

* Microsoft 365
* Azure with valid subscription

2. [Install Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) version v3.0.0+.

## Provision using Teams Toolkit

Provisioning is the same if your project contains multiple capabilities.

### Provision from Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code

1. Open Teams Toolkit in VS Code.

    ![Activate Teams Toolkit ](../images/activate-teams-toolkit.png)

1. In the Teams Toolkit side bar panel, select `Provision in the cloud` option.

    ![Provision in the cloud ](../images/provision-in-cloud.png)

1. Teams Toolkit will ask you to sign in Microsoft 365 account if you haven't sign in.

    ![sign-in M365](../images/sign-in-m365.png)

1. Teams Toolkit will ask you to sign in Azure account if you haven't sign in.

    ![sign-in Azure](../images/sign-in-Azure.png)

1. After sign-in Microsoft 365 and Azure account, click `Provision` in the pop-up window to create cloud resources, you will be asked to select a subscription ro perform provision to.

    ![Select provision](../images/select-provision.png)

    To provision, you can also open command palette and enter **Teams: Provision in the cloud** .

    ![Alternate provision](../images/alternate-provision.png)

### Provision from TeamsFx CLI in Command Window

1. Change directory to your project directory.
1. Execute command `teamsfx provision`.

    ![Execute command](../images/execute-command.png)

## What resources will be created

When you trigger provision command in Teams Toolkit or TeamsFx CLI, the tool will create following resources for you:

* AAD application under your Microsoft 365 tenant
* Teams app registration under your Microsoft 365 tenant's Teams platform
* Azure resources under your selected Azure subscription

When you creates a new project, an ARM template will be generated under your project folder which defines all the Azure resources need to be created. The ARM template will be used to create required Azure resources during provision. When you [adds new capability/resource](./add-resource.md) to an existing project, the ARM template will be updated to reflect the latest change.

Here is full list of resources that might be created during provision.

|Resources|When will it be created|Purpose of this resource| Additional configuration to this resource |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----|
|Teams application | Always | Register your app in Teams platform with information in your app manifest. | Includes additional permissions defined in `permissions.json` under your project |

## Customize provision behavior

You may want to change the out-of-box provision behavior provided by the tooling. This section introduces what kind of customization you can achieve.

### Use an existing AAD app for your Teams app

You can add following configuration snippet to `.fx/configs/config.{env}.json` file to use an AAD app created by yourself for your Teams app. You can follow <https://aka.ms/teamsfx-existing-aad-doc> to create an AAD app that can be used here.

```
"auth": {
    "clientId": "<your AAD app client id",
    "clientSecret": "{{$env.ENV_NAME_THAT_STORES_YOUR_SECRET}}",
    "objectId": "<your AAD app object id>",
    "accessAsUserScopeId": "<id of the access_as_user scope>"
}
```

After added above snippet, add your secret to related environment variable so the tooling can resolve the actual secret during provision.

> Note: You should not share one AAD app in multiple environments. If you do not have permission to update the AAD app, you will get a warning with instructions about how to manually update the AAD app. Please follow the instructions to update your AAD app after provision.

### Use an existing AAD app for your bot

You can add following configuration snippet to `.fx/configs/config.{env}.json` file to use an AAD app created by yourself for your bot.

```
"bot": {
    "appId": "<your AAD app client id>",
    "appPassword": "{{$env.ENV_NAME_THAT_STORES_YOUR_SECRET}}"
}
```

After added above snippet, add your secret to related environment variable so the tooling can resolve the actual secret during provision.

> Note: You should not share one AAD app in multiple environments.

### Skip adding user for SQL database

Sometimes you may get insufficient permission error when the tool tries to add user to SQL database. You can add following configuration snippet to `.fx/configs/config.{env}.json` file to skip adding SQL database user.

```
"skipAddingSqlUser": true
```

### Customize Azure resource group name

Before provision, the tool will ask you if you want to create a new resource group or use an existing one. You can provide a new resource group name or choose an existing one in this step.

### Customize Azure resource being created

The tooling uses ARM template to define Azure resources. The ARM template is a set of bicep files that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. You can customize Azure resources being created by modifying the ARM template. Visit [bicep document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/) to learn more about how to use bicep to author ARM template.

You have two ways to customize Azure resources being created: customizing the parameter files and customizing the bicep files.

#### Customize ARM template parameter files

The tooling provides a set of predefined parameters for you to customize the Azure resources. The parameter files are located at `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.{env}.json` and all the available parameters and defined in the `provisionParameters` property. It's preferred to customize the parameter files if the predefined parameters satisfies your requirement.

Here's a list of predefined parameters available:
| Parameter name | Default Value | What can be customized by the parameter | Value constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resourceBaseName | auto generated for each environment | Default name for all resources | 2-20 lowercase letters and numbers |
| simpleAuthServerFarmsName | ${resourceBaseName}simpleAuth | Name of Simple Auth App Service Plan | 1-40 alphanumerics and hyphens |
| simpleAuthWebAppName | ${resourceBaseName}simpleAuth | Name of Simple Auth Web App | 2-60 alphanumerics and hyphens <br /> Cannot start or end with hyphen |
| simpleAuthSku | F1 | SKU of Simple Auth App Service Plan | Please refer Web App's available SKU in your region in [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/windows/#pricing) page |
| frontendHostingStorageName | ${resourceBaseName}tab | Name of Frontend Hosting Storage Account | 3-24 lowercase letters and numbers |
| functionServerfarmsName | ${resourceBaseName}api | Name of Function App's App Service Plan | 1-40 alphanumerics and hyphens |
| functionAppName | ${resourceBaseName}api | Name of Function App | 2-60 alphanumerics and hyphens <br /> Cannot start or end with hyphen |
| functionStorageName | ${resourceBaseName}api | Name of Function App's Storage Account | 3-24 lowercase letters and numbers |
| botServiceName | ${resourceBaseName} | Name of Azure Bot service | 2-64 alphanumerics, underscores, periods, and hyphens <br /> Start with alphanumeric |
| botDisplayName | ${resourceBaseName} | Display name of your bot | 1-42 characters |
| botServerfarmsName | ${resourceBaseName}bot | Name of Bot's App Service Plan | 1-40 alphanumerics and hyphens |
| botWebAppName | ${resourceBaseName}bot | Name of Bot's Web App | 2-60 alphanumerics and hyphens <br /> Cannot start or end with hyphen |
| botWebAppSKU | F1 | SKU of Bot App Service Plan | Please refer Web App's available SKU in your region in [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/windows/#pricing) page |
| userAssignedIdentityName | ${resourceBaseName} | Name of user assigned identity | 3-128 alphanumerics, hyphens, and underscores <br /> Start with letter or number |
| azureSqlServerName | ${resourceBaseName} | Name of Azure SQL Server | 1-63 lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens <br /> Cannot start or end with hyphen |
| azureSqlDatabaseName | ${resourceBaseName} | Name of Azure SQL Database | 1-128 characters, can't use <>*%&:\/? or control characters <br /> Can't end with period or space |
| apimServiceName | ${resourceBaseName} | Name of APIM Service | 1-50 alphanumerics and hyphens <br /> Start with letter and end with alphanumeric |
| apimProductName | ${resourceBaseName} | Name of APIM Product | 1-80 alphanumerics and hyphens <br /> Start with letter and end with alphanumeric |
| apimOauthServerName | ${resourceBaseName} | Name of APIM OAuth Server | 1-80 alphanumerics and hyphens <br /> Start with letter and end with alphanumeric |

In the meanwhile, following parameters are available with values populated during provision. If you want to change value of these parameters, you can delete the placeholder and fill your expected value to it directly. The purpose of these placeholders is to ensure we can create new resources for you when you created a new environment. The actual values are resolved from `.fx/states/state.{env}.json`.
| Parameter name | Default value place holder | Meaning of the place holder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| m365ClientId | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.clientId}} | Your app's AAD app client id created during provision |
| m365ClientSecret | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.clientSecret}} | Your app's AAD app client secret created during provision |
| m365TenantId | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.tenantId}} | Tenant id of your app's AAD app |
| m365OauthAuthorityHost | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.oauthHost}} | OAuth authority host of your app's AAD app |
| azureSqlAdmin | {{state.fx-resource-azure-sql.admin}} | Azure SQL Server admin account you provided during provision |
| azureSqlAdminPassword | {{state.fx-resource-azure-sql.adminPassword}} | Azure SQL Server admin password you provided during provision |
| botAadAppClientId | {{state.fx-resource-bot.botId}} | Bot's AAD app client id created during provision |
| botAadAppClientSecret | {{state.fx-resource-bot.botPassword}} | Bot's AAD app client secret created during provision |
| apimClientId | {{state.fx-resource-apim.apimClientAADClientId}} | APIM's AAD app client id created during provision |
| apimClientSecret | {{state.fx-resource-apim.apimClientAADClientSecret}} | APIM's AAD app client secret created during provision |
| apimPublisherEmail | {{state.fx-resource-apim.publisherEmail}} | APIM's publisher email, default value is your Azure account |
| apimPublisherName | {{state.fx-resource-apim.publisherName}} | APIM's publisher name, default value is your Azure account |

##### Referencing environment variables in parameter files

Some times you may not want to hardcode the values in parameter files. For example, when the value is a secret. The parameter files support referencing the values from environment variables. You can use syntax `{{$env.YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}}` in parameter values to tell the tooling that the value needs to be resolved from current environment variable.

Following example will read the value of `mySelfHostedDbConnectionString` parameter from environment variable `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`:

```
...
    "mySelfHostedDbConnectionString": "{{$env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING}}"
...
```

##### Example: specifying the name of Function App instance

This this example, I will specify another name `contosoteamsappapi` for Function App instance instead of using the default name.

The steps are:

1. Open `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.{env}.json` for your current environment.
2. Add a new property `functionAppName` to the value of parameter `provisionParameters`.
3. Fill "contosoteamsappapi" as value of `functionAppName`
4. The final parameter file will looks like following

    ```
    {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {
            "provisionParameters": {
            "value": {
                "functionAppName": "contosoteamsappapi"
                ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

Note: If you already provisioned the environment, specifying the name will create a new Function App instance for you, instead of renaming the instance created previously.

#### Customize ARM template

If the predefined parameters does not satisfy your requirement, you can customize the ARM template under `templates/azure` folder. For example, you can customize the ARM template to create some additional Azure resources for your app. This is an advance scenario and requires you have basic knowledge of bicep language which is used to author ARM template. You can get started with bicep at [bicep documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/).

> Note: the ARM template is shared by all environments. You can use [conditional deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/conditional-resource-deployment) if the provision behavior various between environments.

##### ARM template structure

The ARM template located at `templates/azure` contains following files

| File | What does it do | Can be customized |
| --- | --- | --- |
| main.bicep | Entry point for Azure resource provision | Yes |
| provision.bicep | Create and config Azure resources | Yes |
| config.bicep | Add TeamsFx required configurations to Azure resources | Yes |
| provision/xxx.bicep | Consumed by provision.bicep to create and config each Azure resources | Yes |
| teamsfx/xxx.bicep | Consumed by config.bicep to add TeamsFx required configurations to each Azure resources | No |

> Note: teamsfx/xxx.bicep will be regenerated when you add resources / capabilities to your project. That's why it's marked as not customizable. If you realy have requirement to modify these bicep files, go ahead. We suggest using Git to track your changes to teamsfx/xxx.bicep files so you won't lose your changes when adding resources / capabilities.

##### Requirement to customized ARM template

To ensure the TeamsFx tooling functions properly, please ensure your customized ARM template satisfies following requirement. If you uses other tooling for further development, you can ignore these requirement.

1. Keep the folder structure and file name unchanged. The tool may append new content to existing files when you adds more resources / capabilities to your project.
2. Keep the name of auto generated parameters as well as its property names unchanged. The auto generated parameters may be used when you adds more resources / capabilities to your project.
3. Keep the output of auto generated ARM template unchanged. You can add additional outputs to ARM template. The output will be persisted to `.fx/states/state.{env}.json` and used in other features like deploy, validate manifest file, etc.

##### Sample: Add other Azure resource (Azure Storage) to the application

Consider the scenario, you want to add Azure Storage to your Azure Function backend to store some blob data. There is no auto flow to update the bicep template with Azure Storage support. However, you can edit the bicep file and add the resource. The steps are as follows

1. Create a tab project
2. Add a function to the project. You can visit [Add Resources](./add-resource.md) to learn more about adding resources.
3. Declare the new Storage Account in ARM template. For simplify, we will declare the resource at `templates/azure/provision/function.bicep` directly. You're free to declare the resources in other places.

    `````````
    var applicationStorageAccountName = 'myapp${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
    resource applicationStorageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-06-01' = {
        name: applicationStorageAccountName
        location: resourceGroup().location
        kind: 'Storage'
        sku: {
            name: 'Standard_LRS'
        }
    }
    `````````

4. Update the Azure Function App Settings with Azure Storage connection string in `templates/azure/provision/function.bicep`, which is the same file in step 3. Add following snippet to `functionApp` resource's `appSettings` array.

    ``````````````````
    {
        name: 'MyAppStorageAccountConnectionString'
        value: 'DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=${applicationStorageAccount.name};AccountKey=${listKeys(applicationStorageAccount.id, '2021-06-01').key1}'
    }
    ```````````````````

5. Now your can update your function with Azure Storage output bindings.

### Teams app

Please refer [manifest customization](./manifest-customization.md) for more details.

When you finished customizing the Teams app, you need to trigger provision command again for each environment to apply the changes.

## FAQ

### How can I switch to another Azure subscription when provision

1. Switch subscription in current account or log out and select a new subscription.
2. If you already provisioned current environment, you need to create a new environment and perform provision because ARM does not support moving resources.
3. If you did not provision current environment, you can trigger provision directly.

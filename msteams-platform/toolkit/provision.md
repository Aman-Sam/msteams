# Provision cloud resources

TeamsFx integrates with Azure and the Microsoft 365 cloud, which allows to place your app in Azure with a single command. TeamsFx integrates with Azure Resource Manager (ARM), which enables to provision Azure resources that your application needs for code approach.

## Provision using Teams Toolkit in Microsoft Visual Studio Code

Provision Azure resources with a single command in Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code or TeamsFx CLI. For more information, see [how to provision Azure-based app](/microsoftteams/platform/sbs-gs-javascript?tabs=vscode%2Cvsc%2Cviscode%2Cvcode&tutorial-step=8).

## Create Resources

When you trigger the provision command in Teams Toolkit or TeamsFx CLI, you can get the following resources:

* Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) app under your Microsoft 365 tenant.
* Teams app registration under your Microsoft 365 tenant's Teams platform.
* Azure resources under your selected Azure subscription.

When you create a new project, you also need to create Azure resources. The ARM template defines all the Azure resources and helps to create required Azure resources during provision. When you [add a new capability resource](./add-resource.md) to an existing project, the updated ARM template reflects the latest change.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure services incur costs in your subscription. For more information on cost estimation, see [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

The following list shows the resource creation for different types of app and Azure resources:

## Customize resource provision

Teams Toolkit enables you to use an infrastructure-as-code approach to define the Azure resources that you want to provision and how you want to configure. Teams toolkit uses the ARM template to define Azure resources. The ARM template is a set of `bicep` files that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. You can customize Azure resources by modifying the ARM template. For more information, see [bicep document](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep).

Provision with ARM involves changing the following sets of files, parameters, and templates:

* ARM parameter files (`azure.parameters.{your_env_name}.json`) located at `.fx\configs` folder, for passing parameters to templates.
* ARM template files located at `templates\azure`, this folder contains following files:

   | File | Function | Allow customization |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | main.bicep | Provides an entry point for Azure resource provision. | Yes |
   | provision.bicep | Creates and configures Azure resources. | Yes |
   | config.bicep | Adds TeamsFx required configurations to Azure resources. | Yes |
   | provision\xxx.bicep | Creates and configures each Azure resource consumed by `provision.bicep`. | Yes |
   | teamsfx\xxx.bicep | Adds TeamsFx required configurations to each Azure resource consumed by `config.bicep`.| No |

> [!NOTE]
> When you add resources or capabilities to your project, `teamsfx\xxx.bicep` is regenerated, you can't customize the same. To modify the `bicep` files, you can use Git to track your changes to `teamsfx\xxx.bicep` files, which helps you not lose changes while adding resources or capabilities.

### Azure AD parameters

The ARM template files use placeholders for parameters. The purpose of the placeholders is to ensure that the creation of new resources for you in a new environment. The actual values are resolved from `.fx\states\state.{env}.json` file.

There are two types of parameters:

* [Azure AD application-related parameters](#azure-ad-application-related-parameters)
* [Azure resource-related parameters](#azure-resource-related-parameters)

##### Azure AD application-related parameters

| Parameter name | Default value placeholder | Meaning of the placeholder | How to customize |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft 365 ClientId | `{{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.clientId}}` | Your app's Azure AD app client Id is created during provision. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot). |
| Microsoft 365 ClientSecret | `{{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.clientSecret}}` | Your app's Azure AD app client secret is created during provision. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app). |
| Microsoft 365 TenantId | `{{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.tenantId}}` | Tenant Id of your app's Azure AD app. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app).  |
| Microsoft 365 OAuthAuthorityHost | `{{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.oauthHost}}` | OAuth authority host of your app's Azure AD app. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app). |
| botAadAppClientId | `{{state.fx-resource-bot.botId}}` | Bot's Azure AD app client Id created during provision. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot). |
| botAadAppClientSecret | `{{state.fx-resource-bot.botPassword}}` | Bot's Azure AD app client secret is created during provision. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot). |

##### Azure resource-related parameters

| Parameter name | Default value placeholder | Meaning of the placeholder | How to customize |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| azureSqlAdmin | `{{state.fx-resource-azure-sql.admin}}` | Azure SQL Server admin account you provided during provision. | Delete the placeholder and fill the actual value. |
| azureSqlAdminPassword | `{{state.fx-resource-azure-sql.adminPassword}}` | Azure SQL Server admin password you provided during provision. | Delete the placeholder and fill the actual value. |

#### Reference environment variables in parameter files

When the value is secret, then you don't need to hardcode them in parameter file. The parameter files support referencing the values from environment variables. You can use the syntax `{{$env.YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}}` in parameter values for the tool to resolve the current environment variable.

The following example reads the value of the `mySelfHostedDbConnectionString` parameter from the environment variable `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`:

```json
...
    "mySelfHostedDbConnectionString": "{{$env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING}}"
...
```

#### Customize ARM template files

If the predefined templates don't meet your app requirements, you can customize the ARM templates under `templates\azure` folder. For example, you can customize the ARM template to create some extra Azure resources for your app. You need to have basic knowledge of the bicep language, which is used to author an ARM template. You can get started with bicep at [bicep documentation](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/).

> [!NOTE]
> The ARM template is shared by all environments. You can use [conditional deployment](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/conditional-resource-deployment) if the provision behavior varies between the environments.

To ensure the TeamsFx tool functions properly, customize ARM template that satisfies the following requirements:

> [!NOTE]
> If you use other tool for further development, you can ignore these requirements.

* Ensure that the folder structure and file name remain unchanged. The tool may append new content to the existing files when you add more resources or capabilities to your project.
* Ensure that the names of the auto-generated parameters and its property names remain unchanged. The auto-generated parameters may be used when you add more resources or capabilities to your project.
* Ensure that the output of the auto-generated ARM template remain unchanged. You can add more outputs to the ARM template. The output is `.fx\states\state.{env}.json` and can be used in other features, such as deploy and validate manifest file.

### Customize Teams apps

You can customize your bot or the Teams app by adding configuration snippets to use an Azure AD app created by you. Perform the following ways to customize the Teams app:

* [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app)
* [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot-1)

#### Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app

You can add the following configuration snippet to `.fx\configs\config.{env}.json` file to use an Azure AD app created for your Teams app, to create an Azure AD app, see [how to use existing Azure AD app in TeamsFx project](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/docs/fx-core/using-existing-aad.md).:

```json
"auth": {
    "clientId": "<your Azure AD app client id>",
    "clientSecret": "{{$env.ENV_NAME_THAT_STORES_YOUR_SECRET}}",
    "objectId": "<your Azure AD app object id>",
    "accessAsUserScopeId": "<id of the access_as_user scope>"
}
```

After adding the snippet, add your client secret to the related environment variable for Teams Toolkit to resolve the actual client secret during provision.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure not to share the same Azure AD app in multiple environments. If you don't have permission to update the Azure AD app, you get a warning with instructions about how to manually update the Azure AD app. Follow the instructions to update your Azure AD app after provision.

#### Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot

You can add following configuration snippet to `.fx\configs\config.{env}.json` file to use an Azure AD app created for your bot:

```json
"bot": {
    "appId": "<your Azure AD app client id>",
    "appPassword": "{{$env.ENV_NAME_THAT_STORES_YOUR_SECRET}}"
}
```

After adding the snippet, add your client secret to related environment variable for Teams Toolkit to resolve the actual client secret during provision.

#### Skip adding user for SQL database

If you have an insufficient permission error when Teams Toolkit tries to add a user to the SQL database, you can add the following configuration snippet to `.fx\configs\config.{env}.json` file to skip adding the SQL database user:

```json
"skipAddingSqlUser": true
```

### Specify the name of function app instance

You can use `contosoteamsappapi` for function app instance instead of using the default name.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already provisioned the environment, specifying the name can create a new function app instance for you, instead of renaming the instance created previously.

Follow the steps to specify the name of the function app instance:

1. Open `.fx\configs\azure.parameters.{env}.json` for your current environment.
2. Add a new property, for example, `functionAppName` under the `provisionParameters` section.
3. Enter a value of `functionAppName`, for example `contosoteamsappapi`.
4. Final parameter file is shown in the following snippet:

    ```json
    {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {
            "provisionParameters": {
            "value": {
                "functionAppName": "contosoteamsappapi"
                ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

To add other Azure resource or storage to the app, consider the following scenario:

Add Azure storage to your Azure function back-end to store blob data. There's no auto flow to update the `bicep` template with the Azure storage support. However, you can edit the `bicep` file and add the resource. Follow these steps:

1. Create a tab project.
2. Add function to the project. For more information, see [how to add resources](./add-resource.md).
3. Declare the new storage account in ARM template. You can declare the resource at `templates\azure\provision\function.bicep` directly. You can declare the resources in other places.

    `````````bicep
    var applicationStorageAccountName = 'myapp${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
    resource applicationStorageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-06-01' = {
        name: applicationStorageAccountName
        location: resourceGroup().location
        kind: 'Storage'
        sku: {
            name: 'Standard_LRS'
        }
    }
    `````````

4. Update the Azure Functions app settings with Azure storage connection string in `templates\azure\provision\function.bicep`. Add the following snippet to `functionApp` resource's `appSettings` array:

    ``````````````````bicep
    {
        name: 'MyAppStorageAccountConnectionString'
        value: 'DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=${applicationStorageAccount.name};AccountKey=${listKeys(applicationStorageAccount.id, '2021-06-01').keys[0].value}'
    }
    ```````````````````

5. You can update your function with Azure storage output bindings.

### Manage your resources

You can sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and manage all resources created by Teams Toolkit.

* You can select a resource group from the existing list or the new resource group that you've created.
* You can see the details of the resource group you've selected in the overview section of the table of contents.

## Customize resource provision

Teams Toolkit enables you to use an infrastructure-as-code approach to define the Azure resources that you want to provision. You can change the configuration in Teams Toolkit as per your requirement.

Teams Toolkit uses ARM template to define Azure resources. The ARM template is a set of `bicep` files that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. You can customize Azure resources by modifying the ARM template. For more information, see [bicep document](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep).

Provision with ARM involves changing the following sets of files, parameters, and templates:

* ARM parameter files (`azure.parameters.{your_env_name}.json`) located in `.fx\configs` folder, for passing parameters to templates.
* ARM template files located in `templates\azure` folder contains following files:

  | File | Function | Allow customization |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | main.bicep | Provides an entry point for Azure resource provision. | Yes |
  | provision.bicep | Creates and configures Azure resources. | Yes |
  | config.bicep | Adds TeamsFx required configurations to Azure resources. | Yes |
  | provision\xxx.bicep | Creates and configures each Azure resource consumed by `provision.bicep`. | Yes |
  | teamsfx\xxx.bicep | Adds TeamsFx required configurations to each Azure resource consumed by `config.bicep`.| No |

> [!NOTE]
> When you add resources or capabilities to your project, `teamsfx\xxx.bicep` is regenerated, you can't customize the same. To modify the bicep files, you can use Git to track your changes to `teamsfx\xxx.bicep` files. This doesn't make you lose any changes while adding resources or capabilities to your project.

The ARM template files use placeholders for parameters. The purpose of the placeholders is to ensure that new resources can be created in a new environment. The actual values are resolved from `.fx\states\state.{env}.json` file.

### Azure AD app related parameters

| Parameter name | Default value placeholder | Meaning of the placeholder | How to customize |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft 365 ClientId | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.clientId}} | Your app's Azure AD app client Id created during provision. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app). |
| Microsoft 365 ClientSecret | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.clientSecret}} | Your app's Azure AD app client secret is created during provision. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app).  |
| Microsoft 365 TenantId | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.tenantId}} | Tenant Id of your app's Azure AD app. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app).  |
| Microsoft 365 OAuthAuthorityHost | {{state.fx-resource-aad-app-for-teams.oauthHost}} | OAuth authority host of your app's Azure AD app. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app). |
| botAadAppClientId | {{state.fx-resource-bot.botId}} | Bot's Azure AD app client Id is created during provision. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot). |
| botAadAppClientSecret | {{state.fx-resource-bot.botPassword}} | Bot's Azure AD app client secret is created during provision. | [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot). |

### Reference environment variables in parameter files

When the value is secret, then you don't need to hardcode them in parameter file. The parameter files support referencing the values from the environment variables. You can use this syntax `{{$env.YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}}` in the parameter values for Teams Toolkit to resolve from the current environment variable.

The following example reads the value of the `mySelfHostedDbConnectionString` parameter from the environment variable `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`:

```json
...
    "mySelfHostedDbConnectionString": "{{$env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING}}"
...
```

### Customize ARM template files

If the predefined templates don't meet your app requirements, you can customize the ARM templates under `templates\azure` folder. For example, you can customize the ARM template to create some extra Azure resources for your app. You need to have basic knowledge of bicep language, which is used to author ARM template.

To ensure the TeamsFx tool functions properly, customize ARM template that satisfies the following requirements:

* Ensure that the folder structure and file name remain unchanged. The tool may append new content to the existing files when you add more resources or capabilities to your project.
* Ensure that the name of auto-generated parameters and its property names remain unhanged. The auto-generated parameters may be used when you add more resources or capabilities to your project.
* Ensure that the output of auto-generated ARM template is unchanged. You can add more outputs to ARM template. The output is `.fx\states\state.{env}.json` and can be used in other features, such as deploy and validate manifest files.

### Customize Teams app

You can customize your bot or the Teams app by adding configuration snippets to use an Azure AD app created for your Teams app.
Perform in the following ways to customize the Teams app:

* [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app)
* [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot)

#### Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app

You can add the following configuration snippet to `.fx\configs\config.{env}.json` file to use an Azure AD app created for your Teams app, to create an Azure AD app, see <https://aka.ms/teamsfx-existing-aad-doc>:

```json
"auth": {
    "clientId": "<your Azure AD app client id>",
    "clientSecret": "{{$env.ENV_NAME_THAT_STORES_YOUR_SECRET}}",
    "objectId": "<your Azure AD app object id>",
    "accessAsUserScopeId": "<id of the access_as_user scope>"
}
```

After adding the snippet, add your client secret to the related environment variable for Teams Toolkit to resolve the actual client secret during provision.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that not to share the same Azure AD app in multiple environments. If you don't have permission to update the Azure AD app, you get a warning with instructions to manually update the Azure AD app. Follow these instructions to update your Azure AD app after provision.

#### Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot

You can add the following configuration snippet to `.fx\configs\config.{env}.json` file to use the Azure AD app created for your bot:

```json
"bot": {
    "appId": "<your Azure AD app client id>",
    "appPassword": "{{$env.ENV_NAME_THAT_STORES_YOUR_SECRET}}"
}
```

After adding the snippet, add your client secret to the related environment variable for Teams Toolkit to resolve the actual client secret during provision.

#### Skip adding user for SQL database

If you get an insufficient permission error when Teams Toolkit tries to add user to SQL database, add the following configuration snippet to `.fx\configs\config.{env}.json` file to skip adding SQL database user:

```json
"skipAddingSqlUser": true
```

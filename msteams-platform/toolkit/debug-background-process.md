# Debug background process

The local debug workflow involves the `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` files to configure the debugger in Visual Studio Code, then the Visual Studio Code launches the debuggers, and Microsoft Edge or Chrome debugger launches a new browser instance as follows:

1. The `launch.json` file configures the debugger in Visual Studio Code. 

2. Visual Studio Code runs the compound `preLaunchTask`, `Pre Debug Check & Start All` in `.vscode/tasks.json` file.

3. Visual Studio Code then launches the debuggers specified in the compound configuration, such as **Attach to Bot**, **Attach to Backend**, **Attach to Frontend**, and **Launch Bot**.

4.  Microsoft Edge or Chrome debugger launches a new browser instance and opens a web page to load Teams client.

## Prerequisites

Teams Toolkit checks the following prerequisites during the debug process:

* Node.js is applicable for the following project types:

  |Project type|Node.js LTS version|
  |----------|--------------------------------|
  |Tab without Azure Functions | 10, 12, **14 (recommended)**, 16 |
  |Tab with Azure Functions | 10, 12, **14 (recommended)**|
  |Bot |  10, 12, **14 (recommended)**, 16|
  |Messaging extension | 10, 12, **14 (recommended)**, 16 |

   
* The Teams toolkit prompts you to sign in to Microsoft 365 account, if you haven't signed in.

* If Custom app uploading or Sideloading for your developer tenant is not turned on then  local debug terminates.

* Ngrok binary version 2.3 is applicable for bot and messaging extension.  If Ngrok is not installed or the version doesn't match the requirement, the Teams toolkit installs Ngrok NPM package `ngrok@4.2.2` in `~/.fx/bin/ngrok`. The Ngrok binary is managed by Ngrok NPM package in `/.fx/bin/ngrok/node modules/ngrok/bin`.

* If Azure Functions Core Tools is not installed or the version doesn't match the requirement, the Teams toolkit installs Azure Functions Core Tools NPM package, azure-functions-core-tools@3 for **Windows** and for **macOs** in  `~/.fx/bin/func`. The Azure Functions Core Tools NPM package in  `~/.fx/bin/func/node_modules/azure-functions-core-tools/bin` folder manages Azure Functions Core Tools binary. For Linux, the local debug terminates.

* If .NET Core SDK version applicable for Azure Functions is not installed or the version  doesn't match the requirement, the Teams Toolkit installs .NET Core SDK for Windows and MacOS in `~/.fx/bin/dotnet`. For Linux, the local debug terminates.

  The following table lists the .NET Core versions:

  | Platform  | Software|
  | --- | --- |
  |Windows, macOs (x64), and Linux | **3.1 (recommended)**, 5.0, 6.0 |
  |macOs (arm64) |6.0 |

* If the development certificate for localhost is not installed for tab in Windows or macOS, the Teams toolkit prompts you to install it.

* If Azure Functions binding extensions defined in `api/extensions.csproj` are not installed, the Teams Toolkit installs Azure Functions binding extensions.

* If NPM packages, applicable for tab app, bot app, messaging extension app, and Azure Functions is not installed, the Teams Toolkit installs all NPM packages.

* The Teams Toolkit starts Ngrok to create a HTTP tunnel for bot and messaging extension.

* If tab, bot, messaging extension, and Azure Function ports are unavailable, the local debug terminates.

  The following table lists the ports available for components:

  | Component  | Port |
  | --- | --- |
  | Tab | 53000 |
  | Bot or messaging extension | 3978 |
  | Node inspector for bot or messaging extension | 9239 |
  | Azure Functions | 7071 |
  | Node inspector for Azure Functions | 9229 |


<!-- The following table lists the limitations if the required software is unavailable for debugging:

|Project type|Installation| Limitation|

|Bot, messaging extension | Ngrok version 2.3| • If Ngrok is not installed or the version doesn't match the requirement, the Teams toolkit installs Ngrok NPM package `ngrok@4.2.2` in `~/.fx/bin/ngrok`. </br> • The Ngrok binary is managed by Ngrok NPM package in `/.fx/bin/ngrok/node modules/ngrok/bin`.|
|Azure functions | Azure Functions Core Tools version 3| • If Azure Functions Core Tools is not installed or the version doesn't match the requirement, the Teams toolkit installs Azure Functions Core Tools NPM package, azure-functions-core-tools@3 for **Windows** and for **macOs** in  `~/.fx/bin/func`. </br> • The Azure Functions Core Tools NPM package in  `~/.fx/bin/func/node_modules/azure-functions-core-tools/bin` manages Azure Functions Core Tools binary.

> [!NOTE]
> If tab, bot, messaging extension, and Azure functions ports are unavailable, the local debug terminates.

Use the following .NET Core versions:

| Platform  | Software|
| --- | --- |
|Windows, macOs (x64), Linux | **3.1 (recommended)**, 5.0, 6.0 |
|macOs (arm64) |6.0 |


> [!NOTE]

When you select **Start Debugging (F5)**, the Teams Toolkit output channel displays the progress and result after checking the prerequisites.

## Register and configure your Teams app

In the set up process, Teams Toolkit prepares the following registrations and configurations for your Teams app:

<!-- 1. [Register and configures Azure AD application](#registers-and-configures-azure-ad-application): Teams Toolkit registers and configures your Azure AD application. -->

<!-- 1. [Registers and configures bot](#registers-and-configures-bot): Teams Toolkit registers and configures your bot for tab or messaging extension app. -->

<!-- 1. [Registers and configures Teams app](#registers-and-configures-teams-app): Teams Toolkit registers and configures your Teams app. -->

### Register and configure an Azure AD application

1. Register an Azure AD application.

1. Creates a Client Secret.

1. Exposes an API.

    a. Configures Application ID URI. For tab, `api://localhost/{appId}`. For bot or messaging extension,  `api://botid-{botid}`.

    b. Adds a scope named `access_as_user`. Enables it for **Admin and users**.

The following table lists the configurations of Microsoft 365 client application with the client Ids:

4. Configures API permissions. Adds Microsoft Graph permission to **User.Read**.

The following table lists the configuration of the authentication as follows:

  | Project type | Redirect URIs for web | Redirect URIs for single-page application |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Tab | `https://localhost:53000/auth-end.html` | `https://localhost:53000/auth-end.html?clientId={appId>}` |
  | Bot or messaging extension | `https://ngrok.io/auth-end.html` | NA |
  
### Register and configure a bot 

For tab app or messaging extension app:

1. Registers an Azure AD application.

1. Creates a Client Secret for the Azure AD application.

1. Registers a bot in [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) using the Azure AD application.

1. Adds Microsoft Teams channel.

1. Configures messaging endpoint as `https://{ngrokTunnelId}.ngrok.io/api/messages`.

### Register and configure an app

Registers a Teams app in [Developer](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home) using the manifest template in `templates/appPackage/manifest.local.template.json`.

After registering and configuring the app, local debug files get generated.

## Take a tour of your app source code

You can view the project folders and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code after the Teams Toolkit registers and configures your app. The following table lists the local debug files and the configuration types:

| Folder name| Contents| Debug configuration type |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  `.fx/configs/localSettings.json` | Local debug configuration file | The values of each configuration generates and saves during local debug. |
|  `templates/appPackage/manifest.local.template.json` | Teams app manifest template file for local debug | The placeholders in the file resolves during local debug. |
|  `tabs/.env.teams.local`  | Environment variables file for tab  | The values of each environment variable generates and saves during local debug. |
|  `bot/.env.teamsfx.local` | Environment variables file for bot and messaging extension| The values of each environment variable generates and saves during local debug. |
| `api/.env.teamsfx.local`  | Environment variables file for Azure Functions | The values of each environment variable generates and saves during local debug. |

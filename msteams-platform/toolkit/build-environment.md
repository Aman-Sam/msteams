# Prepare to build apps with Teams Toolkit

Microsoft Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code offers set of environments to build your Teams app. If you create an app using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, then you can manage the app in the Developer Portal. You can choose anyone of the following environment that best suits your app:

* JavaScript/TypeScript
* SharePoint Framework (SPFx)

## Create your Teams app using JavaScript or TypeScript

Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code supports building the following apps using JavaScript/TypeScript:

* Tab app using JavaScript
* Bot app using JavaScript
* Notification bot with JavaScript
* Command bot with JavaScript
* Message extension app with JavaScript

The apps built with JavaScript have the following advantages:

* App comes with its own UI and UX capabilities that are rich and user friendly.
* Provides quick upgrades to existing apps.
* Distributes apps on multiple platforms, such as Android and iOS.
* Compatible for creating an app with existing APIs.

## Create your Teams app using SPFx

Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code allows you to create tab apps using SPFx. These apps have the following advantages:

* Provides you easy integration with data residing in SharePoint to your Teams.
* You can integrate your SPFx solution with your business APIs secured with Azure Active Directory.
* Gives you Accesses to various open-source tools.
* Creates for your powerful applications that can deliver a great UX.
* Integrates with other Microsoft (Office) 365 workloads easily.
* Delivers flexibility to host applications wherever needed.

## Support for Azure Functions

You can use Teams Toolkit to integrate [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) capabilities into building apps. You can focus on the pieces of code that matter most and Azure Functions does the rest.
Azure functions allow you to implement:

1. System logic into your readily available blocks of code. These blocks are called functions.
1. As the requests increases, Azure Functions meet the demand with as many demands as necessary.

Azure Function integrates with an array of [cloud services](add-resource.md#types-of-cloud-resources) provide feature-rich implementations. The following are just a few common scenarios for Azure functions:

* When building a web API
* Processing to database changes
* Processing Iot data streams
* Managing message queues

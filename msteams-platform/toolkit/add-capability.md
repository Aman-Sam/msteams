| Tabs |  Tabs are simple HTML tags that point to domains declared in the app manifest. You can add tabs as a part of channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user|

| Message extensions | Message extensions help to interact with your web service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client|

## Prerequisite

* Install the [latest version of Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

> [!TIP]
> Ensure you have Teams app project opened in VS code.

The limitations to TeamsFx while adding more capabilities are as follows:

* You can add tabs up to 16 instances
* You can add bot and message extension for one instance each

## Add capabilities

## Add bot, tab and message extension

After adding a bot and message extension, the changes in your project are as follows:

* A bot template code is added into a subfolder with path `yourProjectFolder/bot`. This includes a **hello world** bot application template into your project
* `launch.json` and `task.json` under `.vscode` folder are updated, which includes necessary scripts for Visual Studio Code, and is executed when you want to debug your application locally
* `manifest.template.json` file under `templates/appPackage` folder is updated, which includes the bot related information in the manifest file that represents your application in the Teams Platform. The changes are as follows:
  * The ID of your bot
  * The scopes of your bot
  * The commands that hello world bot application can respond to
* The files under `templates/azure/teamsfx` are be updated, and `templates/azure/provision/xxx`.bicep files are regenerated
* The files under `.fx/config` are regenerated, which ensures your project is set with right configurations for newly added capability

After adding tab, the changes in your project are as follows:

* A frontend tab template code is added into a subfolder with path `yourProjectFolder/tab`, which includes a **hello world** tab application template into your project
* `launch.json` and `task.json` under `.vscode` folder are updated, which includes necessary scripts for Visual Studio Code, and is executed when you want to debug your application locally
* `manifest.template.json` file under `templates/appPackage` folder is updated, which includes tab-related information in the manifest file that represents your application in the Teams Platform. The changes are:
  * The configurable and static tabs
  * The scopes of the tabs
* The files under `templates/azure/teamsfx` will be updated, and `templates/azure/provision/xxx`.bicep file will be regenerated
* The file under `.fx/config` are regenerated, which ensures your project is set with right configurations for newly added capability

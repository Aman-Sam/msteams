# Configure bot capability within your Teams app

abs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. They're simple HTML <iframe> tags that point to domains declared in the app manifest and can be added as part of a channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user. You can include custom tabs with your app to embed your own web content in Teams or add Teams-specific functionality to your web content. Learn more from [Build tabs for Teams](../tabs/what-are-tabs.md).

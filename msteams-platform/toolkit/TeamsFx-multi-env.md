# Manage multiple environments

 Teams Toolkit provides a simple way for you to create and manage multiple environments, provision resources, and deploy artifacts to the target environment for your Microsoft Teams app.

 You can perform the following activities with multiple environments:

1. **Test before production**: You can set up multiple environments, such as dev, test, and staging before publishing a Teams app to production environment in modern app development lifecycle.

2. **Manage app behaviors in different environments**: You can set up different app behaviors for multiple environments, such as enabling telemetry in the production environment.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Ensure that telemetry is disabled in the development environment.

   > [!TIP]
   > Ensure that you have Teams app project opened in Microsoft Visual Studio code.

## Create new environment

After you create a project, Teams Toolkit by default configures:

* **local** environment to represent the local machine environment configuration.
* **dev** environment to represent the remote or cloud environment configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Each project can have one **local** environment but multiple remote environments.

Perform the following steps to create a new environment:

1. Select the **Teams Toolkit** from the Visual Studio Code activity bar.
2. Select **+ Create new environment** under **ENVIRONMENT**.

> [!Note]
> If you have more than one environment, you need to select an existing environment to create the new environment. The command copies the file contents of `config.<newEnv>.json` and `azure.parameters.<newEnv>.json` from the existing environment you've selected to the new environment created.

## Target environment

Teams Toolkit prompts you to select a target environment when you have multiple remote environments.

## Project folder structure

After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files under **EXPLORER** in Visual Studio Code. Besides the custom codes, Teams Toolkit uses some files to maintain the `configs`, `states`, and `templates` of the app. The following list provides files and outlines their relationship with multiple environments:

* `.fx\configs`: Configuration files that user can customize for the Teams app.
  * `config.<envName>.json`: Configuration file for every environment.
  * `azure.parameters.<envName>.json`: Parameters file for Azure bicep provision for every environment.
  * `projectSettings.json`: Global project settings that apply to all environments.
* `.fx\states`: Provision output that is generated by Teams Toolkit. Teams Toolkit creates this folder after you provision resources for your app.
  * `state.<envName>.json`: Provision output file for every environment.
  * `<env>.userdata`: User data for the provision output for every environment.
* `templates`
  * `appPackage`: App manifest template files.
  * `azure`: `bicep` template files.

## Customize resource provision

Teams Toolkit allows you to customize the resource provision in each environment by changing the configuration and template files .

The following table lists the common scenarios for customized resource provision:

| Scenarios | Location| Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customize Azure Resource |`bicep` files under `templates\azure` `.fx\azure.parameters.<envName>.json` | [Customize ARM parameters and templates](provision.md#customize-arm-template-files) |
| Reuse existing Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) app for Teams app | `auth` section in`.fx\config.<envName>.json`|  [Use an existing Azure AD app for your Teams app](provision.md#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app) |
| Reuse existing Azure AD app for bot |`bot` section in`.fx\config.<envName>.json`| [Use an existing Azure AD app for your bot](provision.md#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot) |
| Skip adding user while provisioning SQL |`skipAddingSqlUser` property in`.fx\config.<envName>.json`| [Skip adding user for SQL database](provision.md#skip-adding-user-for-sql-database) |
| Customize app manifest |`manifest.template.json` file is available under `templates\appPackage`| [Preview app manifest in Toolkit](TeamsFx-preview-and-customize-app-manifest.md)|

## Scenarios

You can see the following scenarios to customize the resource provision in different environments:
<br>

<br><details>
<summary><b>Scenario 1: Customize the Teams app name for different environments
</b></summary>

You can set the Teams app name to `myapp(dev)` for the default environment **dev** and `myapp(staging)` for the staging environment **staging**.

Steps for customization:

1. Open config file `.fx\configs\config.dev.json`.
2. Update the property of `manifest` > `appName` > `short` to `myapp(dev)`.

  The updates to `.fx\configs\config.dev.json` are:

  ```json
  {
      "$schema": "https://aka.ms/teamsfx-env-config-schema",
      "description": "You can customize the TeamsFx config for different environments.   Visit https://aka.ms/teamsfx-env-config to learn more about this.",
      "manifest": {
          "appName": {
              "short": "myapp(dev)"
              ...
          }
      }
      ...
  }
  ```

3. Create a new environment and name it **staging** if it doesn't exist.
4. Open config file `.fx\configs\config.staging.json`.
5. Update the same property `myapp(staging)`.
6. Run provision command on **dev** and **staging** environment to update the app name in remote environments. To run provision command with Teams Toolkit, see [how to provision using Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code](provision.md#provision-using-teams-toolkit-in-visual-studio-code).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 2: Customize the Teams app description for different environments</b></summary>

You can set different Teams app descriptions for the different environments:

* For the default environment **dev**, the description is **my app description for dev**.
* For the staging environment **staging**, the description is **my app description for staging**.

Follow these steps for customization:

1. Open config file `.fx\configs\config.dev.json`.
2. Add a new property of `manifest` > `description` > `short` with value **my app description for dev**.

  The updates to `.fx\configs\config.dev.json` are:

  ```json
  {
      "$schema": "https://aka.ms/teamsfx-env-config-schema",
      "description": "You can customize the TeamsFx config for different environments.   Visit https://aka.ms/teamsfx-env-config to learn more about this.",
      "manifest": {
          ...
          "description": {
              "short": "`my app description for dev"
              ...
          }
      }
      ...
  }
  ```

3. Create a new environment and name it **staging** if it doesn't exist.
4. Open config file `.fx\configs\config.staging.json`.
5. Add the same property to **my app description for staging**.
6. Open Teams app manifest template `templates\appPackage\manifest.template.json`.
7. Update the property `description` > `short` to use the variable defined in configure files with braces syntax `{{config.manifest.description.short}}`.
  
  The updates to `manifest.template.json` are:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.11/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
    "manifestVersion": "1.11",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    ...
    "description": {
      "short": "{{config.manifest.description.short}}", 
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
  ```

8. Run provision command against **dev** and **staging** environment to update the app name in remote environments.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 3: Customize Teams app description for all environments</b></summary>

You can set the description of Teams app to **my app description** for all the environments.

As the Teams app manifest template is shared across all environments, you can update the description value in it for your target:

1. Open Teams app manifest template `templates\appPackage\manifest.template.json`.
2. Update the property `description` > `short` with permanent string **my app description**.
  
  The updates to `manifest.template.json` are:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.11/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
    "manifestVersion": "1.11",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    ...
    "description": {
      "short": "my app description",
      ...
    },
    ...
  }

  ```

3. Run the provision command against all environment to update the app name in remote environments.

</details>

<details>
<br><summary><b>Scenario 4: Customize Azure resources for different environment</b></summary>

You can customize Azure resources for each environment; for example edit the environment corresponding to `.fx\configs\azure.parameters.{env}.json` file to specify Azure Function name.

For more information on Bicep template and parameter files, see [how to provision cloud resources](provision.md).

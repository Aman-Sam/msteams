# Create and manage environments for Teams app

 Teams Toolkit provides a simple way for you to create and manage multiple environments, provision, and deploy artifacts to the target environment for Teams App.

 You can perform the following with the multiple environments:

1. **Test before production**: You can set up multiple environments such as dev, test, and staging before publishing a Teams App to production environment in modern app development lifecycle.

2. **Manage app behaviors in different environments**: You can set up different behaviors for multiple environments such as enable telemetry in production environment, however disable it in development environment.

## Create a new environment for Teams app

After creating a new project, Teams Toolkit by default creates:

* One `local` environment to represent the local machine environment configurations
* One `dev` environment to represent the remote or cloud environment configurations

> [!NOTE]
> Each project can have only one `local` environment but multiple remote environments.

**To add another remote environment for Teams app**:

1. Select the **Teams** :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/add-sso/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="sso add sidebar"::: from left navigation bar.
2. Select **+Teams: Create new environment** under the **Environment** section as shown in the following image:

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams toolkit fundamentals/create new env.png" alt-text="create":::

   If you have more than one environments, you need to select an existing environment to create the same. The command copies the file contents of `config.<newEnv>.json` and `azure.parameters.<newEnv>.json` from the existing environment you selected to the new environment created.

## Select target environment for Teams app

You can select the target environment for all environment-related operations. The Toolkit prompts and ask for a target environment when you have multiple remote environments as shown in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams toolkit fundamentals/manifest preview-1.png" alt-text="add env":::

## Project directory structure

After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files under **Explorer** in VS Code. Besides the custom codes, Teams Toolkit uses some files to maintain the config, state, and template of the app. The following list provides files and outlines their relationship with multiple environments.

| Folder name | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `.fx/configs` | Configuration files that user can customize for the Teams app. |
| - `.fx/configs/config.<envName>.json` | Configuration file for every environment. |
| - `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.<envName>.json` | Parameters file for Azure BICEP provision for every environment. |
| - `.fx/configs/projectSettings.json` | Global project settings that apply to all environments. |
| `.fx/states` | Provision output that is generated by Teams Toolkit.  The toolkit creates this folder after you provision resources for your app. |
| - `.fx/states/state.<envName>.json` | Provision output file for every environment. |
| - `.fx/states/<env>.userdata` | Sensitive user data for the provision output for every environment. |
| `templates` | Contains appPackage and azure files. |
| - `templates/appPackage` | App manifest template files, and the app icons: color.png and outline.png. |
| `templates/azure` | BICEP template files |

## Customize resource provision

Teams Toolkit allows you to change the configuration files and template files to customize the resource provision in each environment.

The following table lists the common scenarios for customized resource provision:

| Scenarios | Location| Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customize Azure Resource | <ul> <li>Bicep files under `templates/azure`</li> <li>`.fx/azure.parameters.<envName>.json`</li></ul> | [Customize ARM parameters and templates](provision.md#customize-arm-parameters-and-templates) |

## Scenarios

You can see the following scenarios to customize the resources provision in different environments.
<br>

<br><details>
<summary><b>Scenario 1: Customize Teams app name for different environment
</b></summary>

You can set the Teams app name to `myapp(dev)` for the default environment `dev` and `myapp(staging)` for the staging environment `staging`.

Follow the steps for customization:

1. Open config file `.fx/configs/config.dev.json`.
2. Update the property of *manifest > appName > short* to `myapp(dev)`.

  The updates to `.fx/configs/config.dev.json` are as follows:

  ```json
  {
      "$schema": "https://aka.ms/teamsfx-env-config-schema",
      "description": "You can customize the TeamsFx config for different environments.   Visit https://aka.ms/teamsfx-env-config to learn more about this.",
      "manifest": {
          "appName": {
              "short": "myapp(dev)"
              ...
          }
      }
      ...
  }
  ```

3. Create a new environment and name it `staging` if it doesn't exist.
4. Open config file `.fx/configs/config.staging.json`.
5. Update the same property `myapp(staging)`.
6. Run provision command on `dev` and `staging` environment to update the app name in remote environments. To run provision command with Teams Toolkit, see [provision](provision.md#provision-using-teams-toolkit).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 2: Customize Teams app description for different environment</b></summary>

You can set different Teams app description for the different environments:

* For the default environment `dev`, the description is `my app description for dev`.
* For the staging environment `staging`, the description is `my app description for staging`.

Follow the steps for customization:

1. Open config file `.fx/configs/config.dev.json`.
2. Add new property of *manifest > description > short* with value `my app description for dev`.

  The updates to `.fx/configs/config.dev.json` are as follows:

  ```json
  {
      "$schema": "https://aka.ms/teamsfx-env-config-schema",
      "description": "You can customize the TeamsFx config for different environments.   Visit https://aka.ms/teamsfx-env-config to learn more about this.",
      "manifest": {
          ...
          "description": {
              "short": "`my app description for dev"
              ...
          }
      }
      ...
  }
  ```

3. Create a new environment and name it `staging` if it doesn't exist.
4. Open config file `.fx/configs/config.staging.json`.
5. Add the same property to `my app description for staging`.
6. Open Teams app manifest template `templates/appPackage/manifest.template.json`.
7. Update the property `description > short` to use the **variable** defined in configure files with mustache syntax `{{config.manifest.description.short}}`.
  
  The updates to `manifest.template.json` are as follows:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.11/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
    "manifestVersion": "1.11",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    ...
    "description": {
      "short": "{{config.manifest.description.short}}", 
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
  ```

8. Run provision command against `dev` and `staging` environment to update the app name in remote environments.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Scenario 3: Customize Teams app description for all environments</b></summary>

You can set the description of Teams app to `my app description` for all the environments.

As the Teams app manifest template is shared across all environments, we can update the description value in it for our target:

1. Open Teams app manifest template `templates/appPackage/manifest.template.json`.
2. Update the property `description > short` with **hard-coded string** `my app description`.
  
  The updates to `manifest.template.json` are as follows:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.11/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
    "manifestVersion": "1.11",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    ...
    "description": {
      "short": "my app description",
      ...
    },
    ...
  }

  ```

3. Run the provision command against **all** environment to update the app name in remote environments.

</details>

<details>
<br><summary><b>Scenario 4: customize Azure resources for different environment</b></summary>
You can customize Azure resources for each environment, for example edit the environment corresponding to
fx/configs/azure.parameters.{env}.json file to specify Azure Function name.

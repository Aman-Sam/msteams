# Prepare accounts to build Teams apps

To develop a Teams app, at least one Microsoft 365 account with a valid subscription is needed. If you want to host your backend resources on Azure, an Azure account is also needed. Azure account is optional if your existing application is hosted on other cloud provider and you want to integrate the existing application to Teams platform.

## Microsoft 365 Account

If you don’t have an existing Microsoft 365 account with a valid subscription, you can create one by joining the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program). The Microsoft 365 Developer Program includes a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription that you can use to create your own sandbox and develop solutions independent of your production environment.

## Azure account

If you wish to host your app related resources or access resources **within Azure**, you must have an Azure subscription. You can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Join Microsoft 365 Developer program 

If you don't have a Microsoft 365 account, you must sign up for a [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) subscription. The subscription is free for 90 days and continues to renew as long as you are using it for development activity. If you have a Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional subscription, both programs include a free Microsoft 365 [developer subscription](https://aka.ms/MyVisualStudioBenefits). It is active as long as your Visual Studio subscription is active. For more information, see [set up a Microsoft 365 developer subscription](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
2. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
3. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
4. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, you should see the following screen:

## Accounts for Microsoft 365 Developer Program

You can sign up for the developer program by using one of the following account types:

- **Microsoft account** 

You can create for personal use - Provides access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook, Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox Live, or Microsoft 365. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. After a Microsoft account is created, it can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure.

- **Work account**

 Admin can issue for business use - Provides access to all small, medium, and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. When you sign up to one of these services as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent your organization.

- **Visual Studio ID**

You can create for your Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscriptions - We recommend that you use this option to join the developer program from within the Visual Studio Gallery to get the full benefits as a Visual Studio subscriber.

## Teams customer app uploading (sideloading permission) check

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During development, you must load your app within your Teams without distributing it. This is known as **sideloading**.

One of the ways to check if you have a Teams account, verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

1. In the Teams client, select **Apps** in left bar.
2. Select **Manage your apps**.
3. Check whether you can see the option **Upload a custom app** as shown in the image:

:::image type="content" source="./images/sideload-check.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows to upload a custom app":::

If you cannot see **Upload a custom app** option, this indicates that you don't have sideloading permission. Without sideloading permission, you won’t be able to do any local/remote debugging. So it’s very important to get the sideloading permission for your account before you do any debugging for your Teams app. If you are admin for your tenant, you can open the sideloading setting for your tenant/organization, while if you are not admin, please contact your tenant admin for the permission.

## Enable custom app uploading (sideloading)  for your organization

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To turn on the custom app uploading or sideloading for your developer tenant, you must be the admin for your tenant.

1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/homepage#/) with your admin credentials.

2. Select **Show All** > **Teams**.

:::image type="content" source="./images/admin-center-teams.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows Teams admin center":::

> [!NOTE]
> It can take **up to 24 hours** for the **Teams** option to appear. You can [upload your custom app to a Teams environment](/microsoftteams/upload-custom-apps) for testing and validation in that time.

3. Navigate to **Teams apps** > **Setup Policies** > **Global**.

4. Toggle Upload custom apps to the **On** position.

5. Select **Save**. Your test tenant can permit custom app sideloading.

:::image type="content" source="./images/save-sideload.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows save option":::

> [!Note]
> It can take up to 24 hours for the sideloading to be active. In the meantime, you can use **[upload for your tenant]** to test your app. To upload the .zip package file of the app, see [upload custom apps](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies).

For more information, see [manage custom app policies and settings in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings) and [manage app setup policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies).

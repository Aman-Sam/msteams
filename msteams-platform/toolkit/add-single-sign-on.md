# Add single sign-on to Teams app

Microsoft Teams provides single sign-on (SSO) function for an app to obtain signed in Teams user token to access Microsoft Graph and other APIs. Teams Toolkit facilitates the interaction by abstracting some of the Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) flows and integrations behind some simple APIs. This enables you to add SSO features easily to your Teams app.

::: zone pivot="visual-studio-code"

## Add SSO to Teams app for Microsoft Visual Studio Code

For apps that interact with the user in a chat, Team, or channel, SSO manifests as an Adaptive Card, which the user can interact with to invoke the Azure AD consent flow.

## Enable SSO support

Teams Toolkit helps you to add SSO to the following Teams capabilities in Visual Studio Code:

* Tab
* Bot
* Notification bot: restify server
* Command bot
* Workflow bot
* Message extension

### Add SSO using Visual Studio Code

You can perform the following steps to add SSO using Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code:

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Select **Teams Toolkit** from the Visual Studio Code activity bar.
3. Select **Add features** under **DEVELOPMENT**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/add-sso/sso-add features_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Add features option under the Development option in the Visual Studio Code.":::

   * You can select **View** > **Command Palette...** to view **Add features** window.

4. Select **Single Sign-On**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/add-sso/sso-select features_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Single Sign-on feature highlighted in red in the Visual Studio Code.":::

### Add SSO using TeamsFx CLI

You can run `teamsfx add sso` command in your **project root directory**. The feature enables SSO for all existing applicable capabilities. Follow the same steps to enable SSO if you add capability later to the project.

## Customize your project using Teams Toolkit

The following table lists the changes Teams Toolkit makes to your project:

| **Type** | **File**                                             | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create   | `aad.template.json` under `template\appPackage`      | Azure AD application manifest represents your Azure AD app. `template\appPackage` helps to register an Azure AD app during local debug or provision stage.                                |
| Modify   | `manifest.template.json` under `template\appPackage` | A `webApplicationInfo` object is added into your Teams app manifest template. Teams requires this field to enable SSO. The change is in effect when you trigger local debugging or provisioning. |
| Create   | `auth\tab`                                           | Reference code, auth redirect pages, and `README.md` files are generated in this path for a tab project.                                                                                  |
| Create   | `auth\bot`                                           | Reference code, auth redirect pages, and `README.md` files are generated in this path for a bot project.                                                                                  |

> [!NOTE]
> By adding SSO, Teams Toolkit doesn't change anything in the cloud until you trigger local debug. Update your code to ensure that SSO is working in the project.

## Update your application to use SSO

The steps to enable SSO in your app are based on the template you scaffold. Follow these steps to enable SSO in your app:

---

<br>
<br><details>
<summary><b>Tab project
</b></summary>

1. Copy `auth-start.html` and `auth-end.htm` in `auth\public` folder to `tabs\public\`. Teams Toolkit registers these two endpoints in Azure AD for Azure AD's redirect flow.

2. Copy `sso` folder under `auth\tab` to `tabs\src\sso\`.

   * `InitTeamsFx`: The file implements a function that initializes TeamsFx SDK and opens `GetUserProfile` component after SDK is initialized.

   * `GetUserProfile`: The file implements a function that calls Microsoft Graph API to get user info.

3. Execute `npm install @microsoft/teamsfx-react` under `tabs\`.

4. Add the following lines to `tabs\src\components\sample\Welcome.tsx` to import `InitTeamsFx`:

   ```Bash

   import { InitTeamsFx } from "../../sso/InitTeamsFx";

   ```

5. Replace the following line:

   `<AddSSO />` with `<InitTeamsFx />` to replace the `AddSso` component with `InitTeamsFx` component.

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Bot project
</b></summary>

#### Set up the Azure AD redirects

1. Move the `auth\bot\public` folder to `bot\src`. This folder contains HTML pages that the bot app hosts. When SSO flow is initiated with Azure AD, it redirects you to the HTML pages.
1. Modify your `bot\src\index` to add the appropriate `restify` routes to HTML pages.

   ```ts
   const path = require("path");

   server.get(
     "/auth-*.html",
     restify.plugins.serveStatic({
       directory: path.join(__dirname, "public"),
     })
   );
   ```

#### Update your app

SSO command handler `ProfileSsoCommandHandler` uses an Azure AD token to call Microsoft Graph. This token is obtained by using the signed in Teams user token. The flow is brought together in a dialog that displays a consent dialog if necessary.

1. Move `profileSsoCommandHandler` file under `auth\bot\sso` folder to `bot\src`. `ProfileSsoCommandHandler` class is an SSO command handler to get user info with SSO token, follow this method and create your own SSO command handler.
1. Open `package.json` file and ensure that TeamsFx SDK version >= 1.2.0.
1. Execute the `npm install isomorphic-fetch --save` command in the `bot` folder.
1. For ts script, execute the `npm install copyfiles --save-dev` command in the `bot` folder and replace following lines in `package.json`:

   ```json
   "build": "tsc --build && shx cp -r ./src/adaptiveCards ./lib/src",
   ```

   with

   ```json
   "build": "tsc --build && shx cp -r ./src/adaptiveCards ./lib/src && copyfiles src/public/*.html lib/",
   ```

   This copies the HTML pages used for auth redirect when building the bot project.

1. To make SSO consent flow work, replace the following code in `bot\src\index` file:

   ```ts
   server.post("/api/messages", async (req, res) => {
     await commandBot.requestHandler(req, res);
   });
   ```

   with

   ```ts
   server.post("/api/messages", async (req, res) => {
     await commandBot.requestHandler(req, res).catch((err) => {
       // Error message including "412" means it is waiting for user's consent, which is a normal process of SSO, shouldn't throw this error.
       if (!err.message.includes("412")) {
         throw err;
       }
     });
   });
   ```

1. Replace the following options for `ConversationBot` instance in `bot\src\internal\initialize` to add the SSO config and SSO command handler:

   ```ts
   export const commandBot = new ConversationBot({
       ...
       command: {
           enabled: true,
           commands: [new HelloWorldCommandHandler()],
       },
   });
   ```

   with

   ```ts
   import { ProfileSsoCommandHandler } from "../profileSsoCommandHandler";

   export const commandBot = new ConversationBot({
       ...
       // To learn more about ssoConfig, please refer teamsfx sdk document: https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-sdk
       ssoConfig: {
           aad :{
               scopes:["User.Read"],
           },
       },
       command: {
           enabled: true,
           commands: [new HelloWorldCommandHandler() ],
           ssoCommands: [new ProfileSsoCommandHandler()],
       },
   });
   ```

1. Register your command in the Teams app manifest. Open `templates\appPackage\manifest.template.json`, and add the following lines under `commands` in `commandLists` of your bot:

   ```json
   {
     "title": "profile",
     "description": "Show user profile using Single Sign On feature"
   }
   ```

#### Add a new SSO command to the bot (Optional)

After successfully adding SSO in your project, you can add a new SSO command:

1. Create a new file such as `photoSsoCommandHandler.ts` or `photoSsoCommandHandler.js` in `bot\src\` and add your own SSO command handler to call Graph API:

   ```TypeScript
   // for TypeScript:
   import { Activity, TurnContext, ActivityTypes } from "botbuilder";
   import "isomorphic-fetch";
   import {
       CommandMessage,
       TriggerPatterns,
       TeamsFx,
       createMicrosoftGraphClient,
       TeamsFxBotSsoCommandHandler,
       TeamsBotSsoPromptTokenResponse,
   } from "@microsoft/teamsfx";

   export class PhotoSsoCommandHandler implements TeamsFxBotSsoCommandHandler {
       triggerPatterns: TriggerPatterns = "photo";

       async handleCommandReceived(
           context: TurnContext,
           message: CommandMessage,
           tokenResponse: TeamsBotSsoPromptTokenResponse,
       ): Promise<string | Partial<Activity> | void> {
           await context.sendActivity("Retrieving user information from Microsoft Graph ...");

           const teamsfx = new TeamsFx().setSsoToken(tokenResponse.ssoToken);

           const graphClient = createMicrosoftGraphClient(teamsfx, ["User.Read"]);

           let photoUrl = "";
           try {
               const photo = await graphClient.api("/me/photo/$value").get();
               const arrayBuffer = await photo.arrayBuffer();
               const buffer=Buffer.from(arrayBuffer, 'binary');
               photoUrl = "data:image/png;base64," + buffer.toString("base64");
           } catch {
               // Could not fetch photo from user's profile, return empty string as placeholder.
           }
           if (photoUrl) {
               const photoMessage: Partial<Activity> = {
                   type: ActivityTypes.Message,
                   text: 'This is your photo:',
                   attachments: [
                       {
                           name: 'photo.png',
                           contentType: 'image/png',
                           contentUrl: photoUrl
                       }
                   ]
               };
               return photoMessage;
           } else {
               return "Could not retrieve your photo from Microsoft Graph. Please make sure you have uploaded your photo.";
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   ```javascript
   // for JavaScript:
   const { ActivityTypes } = require("botbuilder");
   require("isomorphic-fetch");
   const {
     createMicrosoftGraphClient,
     TeamsFx,
   } = require("@microsoft/teamsfx");

   class PhotoSsoCommandHandler {
     triggerPatterns = "photo";

     async handleCommandReceived(context, message, tokenResponse) {
       await context.sendActivity(
         "Retrieving user information from Microsoft Graph ..."
       );

       const teamsfx = new TeamsFx().setSsoToken(tokenResponse.ssoToken);

       const graphClient = createMicrosoftGraphClient(teamsfx, ["User.Read"]);

       let photoUrl = "";
       try {
         const photo = await graphClient.api("/me/photo/$value").get();
         const arrayBuffer = await photo.arrayBuffer();
         const buffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer, "binary");
         photoUrl = "data:image/png;base64," + buffer.toString("base64");
       } catch {
         // Could not fetch photo from user's profile, return empty string as placeholder.
       }
       if (photoUrl) {
         const photoMessage = {
           type: ActivityTypes.Message,
           text: "This is your photo:",
           attachments: [
             {
               name: "photo.png",
               contentType: "image/png",
               contentUrl: photoUrl,
             },
           ],
         };
         return photoMessage;
       } else {
         return "Could not retrieve your photo from Microsoft Graph. Please make sure you have uploaded your photo.";
       }
     }
   }

   module.exports = {
     PhotoSsoCommandHandler,
   };
   ```

1. Add `PhotoSsoCommandHandler` instance to `ssoCommands` array in `bot\src\internal\initialize.ts`:

   ```ts
   // for TypeScript:
   import { PhotoSsoCommandHandler } from "../photoSsoCommandHandler";

   export const commandBot = new ConversationBot({
       ...
       command: {
           ...
           ssoCommands: [new ProfileSsoCommandHandler(), new PhotoSsoCommandHandler()],
       },
   });
   ```

   ```javascript
   // for JavaScript:
   ...
   const { PhotoSsoCommandHandler } = require("../photoSsoCommandHandler");

   const commandBot = new ConversationBot({
       ...
       command: {
           ...
           ssoCommands: [new ProfileSsoCommandHandler(), new PhotoSsoCommandHandler()]
       },
   });
   ...

   ```

1. Register your command in the Teams app manifest. Open `templates\appPackage\manifest.template.json`, and add following lines under `commands` in `commandLists` of your bot:

   ```JSON

   {
       "title": "photo",
       "description": "Show user photo using Single Sign On feature"
   }

   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Message extension project
</b></summary>

The sample business logic provides a handler `TeamsBot` extends `TeamsActivityHandler` and override `handleTeamsMessagingExtensionQuery`.

You can update the query logic in the `handleMessageExtensionQueryWithToken` with token, which is obtained by using the signed in Teams user token.

To make this work in your app:

1. Move the `auth\bot\public` folder to `bot`. This folder contains HTML pages that the bot app hosts. When SSO flows are initiated with Azure AD, Azure AD redirects you to these pages.

1. Modify your `bot\index` to add the appropriate `restify` routes to these pages.

    ```ts
    const path = require("path");

    server.get(
        "/auth-*.html",
        restify.plugins.serveStatic({
            directory: path.join(__dirname, "public"),
        })
    );
    ```

1. Override `handleTeamsMessagingExtensionQuery` interface under `bot\teamsBot`. You can follow the sample code in the `handleMessageExtensionQueryWithToken` to do your own query logic.

1. Open `bot\package.json`, ensure that `@microsoft/teamsfx` version >= 1.2.0

1. Install `isomorphic-fetch` npm packages in your bot project.

1. For ts, install `copyfiles` npm packages in your bot project, add or update the `build` script in `bot\package.json` as follows:

    ```json
    "build": "tsc --build && copyfiles ./public/*.html lib/",
    ```

    As you do it, the HTML pages used for auth redirect are copied when you build this bot project.

1. Update `templates\appPackage\aad.template.json` your scopes, which used in `handleMessageExtensionQueryWithToken`.

    ```json
    "requiredResourceAccess": [
        {
            "resourceAppId": "Microsoft Graph",
            "resourceAccess": [
                {
                    "id": "User.Read",
                    "type": "Scope"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    ```

</details>

## Debug your app

Press **F5** to debug your application. Teams Toolkit uses the Azure AD manifest file to register an Azure AD app for SSO. For Teams Toolkit local debug functionalities, see [how to debug your Teams app locally](debug-local.md).

## Customize Azure AD app registration

The [Azure AD app manifest](/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest) allows you to customize various aspects of app registration. You can update the manifest as needed. If you need to include more API permissions to access your desired APIs, see [API permissions to access your desired APIs](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/#customize-aad-manifest-template).
To view your Azure AD app in Azure portal, see [view Azure AD app in Azure portal](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Manage-AAD-application-in-Teams-Toolkit#How-to-view-the-AAD-app-on-the-Azure-portal).

## SSO authentication concepts

The following concepts help you with SSO authentication:

### Working of SSO in Teams

SSO authentication in Azure AD silently refreshes the authentication token to minimize the number of times users need to enter their sign in credentials. If users agree to use your app, they don't have to provide consent again on another device, as they're signed in automatically.

Teams tabs and bots have similar flow for SSO support. For more information, see:

1. [SSO authentication in Tabs](../tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-overview.md)
1. [SSO authentication in Bots](../bots/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso-bots.md)

### Simplified SSO with TeamsFx

TeamsFx helps to reduce the developer tasks by using SSO and accessing cloud resources down to single-line statements with zero configuration.

With TeamsFx SDK, you can write user authentication code in a simplified way using following credentials:

1. User identity in browser environment: `TeamsUserCredential` represents Teams current user's identity.
1. User identity in Node.js environment: `OnBehalfOfUserCredential` uses On-Behalf-Of flow and SSO token.
1. Application Identity in Node.js environment: `AppCredential` represents the application identity.

For more information about TeamsFx SDK, see:

* [TeamsFx SDK](TeamsFx-SDK.md) or [API reference](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teamsfx/?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true)
* [Microsoft Teams Framework (TeamsFx) Sample Gallery](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx-Samples/tree/v2)

## Add SSO to Teams app for Visual Studio

For applications that interact with the user in a chat, Team, or channel, SSO manifests as an Adaptive Card, which the user can interact with to invoke the Azure AD consent flow.

**Advantages**

The following are the advantages of SSO in Teams:

* SSO with Azure AD refreshes the authentication token in the background, which minimizes the number of times users need to enter their sign in credentials.

* SSO signs in the user in different devices automatically, while using the app.

Teams tabs and bots have similar flow for SSO support, for more information, see:

1. [SSO authentication in Tabs](../tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-overview.md)
2. [SSO authentication in Bots](../bots/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso-bots.md)

## Enable SSO support

Teams Toolkit helps you add SSO to the following Teams capabilities in Visual Studio:

* Tab
* Notification bot: Restify server
* Command bot

## Customize your project using Teams Toolkit

The following table lists the changes by Teams Toolkit:

   |**Type**|**File**|**Purpose**|
   |--------|--------|-----------|
   |Create|`aad.template.json` under `template\appPackage`|Azure AD application manifest represents your Azure AD app. `template\appPackage` helps you to register an Azure AD app during local debug or provision.|
   |Modify|`manifest.template.json` under `template\appPackage`|`webApplicationInfo` object is added into your Teams app manifest template. Teams requires this field to enable SSO. When local debugging or provisioning is triggered, you can see the change.|
   |Modify|`appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`|Configs are added and used by TeamsFx SDK to your app settings. You can update and add the `TeamsFx` object if you have other `appsettings` files.|
   |Create|`Auth\tab`|Reference code, auth redirect pages and a `README.md` file are generated in the folder `Auth\tab` for a tab project.|
   |Create|`Auth\bot`|Reference code, auth redirect pages and a `README.md` file are generated in the folder `Auth\bot` for a bot project.|

> [!NOTE]
> Teams Toolkit makes no changes in the cloud by adding SSO, until you trigger a local debug. You can update your code to ensure SSO is working in the project.

## Update your app to use SSO

The following steps help you to enable SSO in your app:

> [!NOTE]
> The changes are based on the scaffold templates.

---
<br>
<br><details>
<summary><b>Tab project
</b></summary>

1. You can move `GetUserProfile.razor` file from the `Auth\tab` folder to the`Components\` folder. `GetUserProfile` file implements a function that uses TeamsFx SDK to call Microsoft Graph API to get the user info.

1. After getting the user info, you can replace `<AddSSO />` with `<GetUserProfile />` in the `Components/Welcome.razor` file.

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Bot project
</b></summary>

1. Ensure to upgrade your SDK version to:
   * TeamsFx, version 1.1.0 or later.
   * `Microsoft.Bot.Builder`, version 4.17.1 or later.

2. Create a `Pages` folder, and move files to the `Auth\bot\Pages`, which contains HTML pages that are hosted by bot app. When SSO authentication process is initiated with Azure AD, they redirect user to the HTML pages.

3. After the user is redirected to the HTML pages, you can create `SSO` folder and move files in `Auth\bot\SSO`. This folder contains three files as a reference for SSO implementation:

   * `SsoDialog.cs`: This file creates a `ComponentDialog` that is used for SSO.

   * `SsoOperations.cs`: This file implements a class in the function to get user info with SSO token. You can follow the method defined in `SsoOperations.cs` and create your own method that requires SSO token.

   * `TeamsSsoBot.cs`: This file creates a `TeamsActivityHandler` with `SsoDialog` that adds and triggers a command `showUserInfo`.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Ensure to replace `{Your_NameSpace}` with your project namespace in the three files (`SsoDialog.cs`, `SsoOperations.cs`, and `TeamsSsoBot.cs`).

4. You can now update `Program.cs`.

    1. You can find the following code in the file `Program.cs`, and add the code blocks in step b:

       ```csharp
          builder.Services.AddSingleton<BotFrameworkAuthentication,              ConfigurationBotFrameworkAuthentication>();
       ```

    1. Add the following code blocks:

        ```csharp
         builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
           // Create the Bot Framework Adapter with error handling enabled.                                        
           builder.Services.AddSingleton<IBotFrameworkHttpAdapter, AdapterWithErrorHandler>();
           builder.Services.AddSingleton<IStorage, MemoryStorage>();
           // Create the Conversation state. (Used by the Dialog system itself.)
           builder.Services.AddSingleton<ConversationState>();
           // The Dialog that will be run by the bot.
           builder.Services.AddSingleton<SsoDialog>();
           // Create the bot as a transient. In this case the ASP Controller is expecting an IBot.
           builder.Services.AddTransient<IBot, TeamsSsoBot<SsoDialog>>();
           builder.Services.AddOptions<AuthenticationOptions>().Bind(builder.Configuration.GetSection("TeamsFx").GetSection(AuthenticationOptions.Authentication)).ValidateDataAnnotations();
           builder.Services.AddOptions<BotAuthenticationOptions>().Configure<IOptions<AuthenticationOptions>>((botAuthOption, authOptions) => {
               AuthenticationOptions authOptionsValue = authOptions.Value;
               botAuthOption.ClientId = authOptionsValue.ClientId;
               botAuthOption.ClientSecret = authOptionsValue.ClientSecret;
               botAuthOption.OAuthAuthority = authOptionsValue.OAuthAuthority;
               botAuthOption.ApplicationIdUri = authOptionsValue.ApplicationIdUri;
               botAuthOption.InitiateLoginEndpoint = authOptionsValue.Bot.InitiateLoginEndpoint;
           }).ValidateDataAnnotations();
       ```

    1. After you've added the code blocks, you can find and delete the following code in the file:

         ```csharp
        // Create the bot as a transient. In this case the ASP Controller is expecting an IBot.
        builder.Services.AddTransient<IBot, TeamsBot>();
        ```

    1. Find the following code and replace it with the codes given in step e:

        ```csharp
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
          endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
        ```

    1. Replace the codes in step d with the following codes:

       ```csharp
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
          endpoints.MapControllers();
          endpoints.MapRazorPages();
        });
        ```

5. You can open `Templates\appPackage\manifest.template.json`, and add the following lines under `command` in `commandLists` of your bot to register your command in the Teams app manifest:

   ```JSON
   {
       "title": "show",
       "description": "Show user profile using Single Sign On feature"
   }
   ```

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Add a new command to the bot
</b></summary>

The following steps help to add a new command, after you've added SSO in your project:

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions apply only to command bot.

1. You can create a new method in class `SsoOperations` in `SSO/SsoOperations` and add your own business logic to call Graph API:

    ```csharp
    public static async Task GetUserImageInfo(ITurnContext stepContext, string token, BotAuthenticationOptions botAuthOptions)
    {
        await stepContext.SendActivityAsync("Retrieving user information from Microsoft Graph ...");
        var authProvider = new DelegateAuthenticationProvider((request) =>
        {
            request.Headers.Authorization =
                new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        });
        var graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(authProvider);
        // You can add following code to get your photo size:
        // var photo = await graphClient.Me.Photo.Request().GetAsync();
        // await stepContext.SendActivityAsync($"Size of your photo is: {photo.Width} * {photo.Height}");
    }
    ```

1. Find the following line to register a new command:

   ```csharp
      ((SsoDialog)_dialog).addCommand("showUserInfo", "show", SsoOperations.ShowUserInfo);
   ```

1. You can register the new command `"photo"` to configure the method `'GetUserImageInfo'` by adding the following code:

    ```csharp
       ((SsoDialog)_dialog).addCommand("getUserImageInfo", "photo", SsoOperations.GetUserImageInfo);
    ```

1. Open the file `templates\appPackage\manifest.template.json`, and add the following lines under `command` in `commandLists` of your bot to register your command in the Teams app manifest:

   ```JSON
       {
           "title": "photo",
           "description": "Show user photo size using Single Sign On feature"
       }
    ```

  > Teams Toolkit uses the Azure AD manifest file to register an Azure AD app for SSO. You need to press **F5** to debug your app and test your SSO configuration.

## Customize Azure AD app registration

The [Azure AD app manifest](/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest) allows you to customize various aspects of app registration. You can update the manifest file as needed. If you need to include more API permissions to access your required APIs, see [API permissions to access your desired APIs](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/#customize-aad-manifest-template).
For more information on viewing your Azure AD app in Azure portal, see [how to view Azure AD application in Azure portal](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Manage-AAD-application-in-Teams-Toolkit#How-to-view-the-AAD-app-on-the-Azure-portal).

### Simplified SSO with TeamsFx

TeamsFx helps to reduce your tasks by using SSO and accessing cloud resources down to single-line statements with zero configuration. With TeamsFx SDK, you can write user authentication code with the user identity `TeamsUserCredential`, such as in a browser environment.

For more information on TeamsFx SDK, see:

* [TeamsFx SDK](TeamsFx-SDK.md) or [API reference](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teamsfx/?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true)
* [Microsoft Teams Framework (TeamsFx) Sample Gallery](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx-Samples/tree/v2)

## How to use an existing Azure AD app

For more information about how to use an existing Azure AD app in your TeamsFx project, see the [steps](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Using-existing-Azure-AD-app-in-TeamsFx-project).

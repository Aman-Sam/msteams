# Debug background process

The local debug workflow involves the `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` files to configure the debugger in Visual Studio Code as follows:

1. The `launch.json` file configures the debugger in Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code runs the compound configurations `preLaunchTask`, `Pre Debug Check`, and `Start All`, which is defined in `.vscode/tasks.json` file.

2. Visual Studio Code launches the debuggers specified in the compound configurations, such as **Attach to Bot**, **Attach to Backend**, **Attach to Frontend**, and **Launch Bot**.

3. Microsoft Edge or Chrome debugger launches a new browser instance and opens a web page to load Teams client.

## Prerequisites

The following table lists the limitations if the required softwares is unavailable for debugging:

| Software | Installation | Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) | The local debug terminates, if you haven't installed Node.js or the version doesn't match the requirement.|
|Tab without Azure functions | 10, 12, 14 (recommended), 16 | The local debug terminates, if you have not installed Node.js or the version doesn't match the requirement.|
|Tab with Azure functions | 10, 12, 14 (recommended) |The local debug terminates, if you have not installed Node.js or the version doesn't match the requirement.|
|Bot | 10, 12, 14 (recommended), 16 |The local debug terminates, if you have not installed Node.js or the version doesn't match the requirement.|
|Messaging extension | 10, 12, 14 (recommended), 16 |The local debug terminates, if you have not installed Node.js or the version doesn't match the requirement.|
|Sign in to Microsoft 365 account | Teams toolkit prompts to sign in to Microsoft 365 account, if you have not signed in |Microsoft 365 credentials. |
|Bot, messaging extension | Install Ngrok. The Ngrok binary requires version 2.3.| <br> • If you have not installed Ngrok or the version doesn't match the requirement, the toolkit installs Ngrok NPM package `ngrok@4.2.2` in `~/.fx/bin/ngrok`. </br> <br> • The Ngrok binary is managed by Ngrok NPM package in `/.fx/bin/ngrok/node modules/ngrok/bin`.|</br>
|Azure functions | Install Azure Functions Core Tools. The Azure Functions Core Tools requires binary version 3.|<br> • If you have not installed Azure Functions Core Tools or the version doesn't match the requirement, the toolkit installs Azure Functions Core Tools NPM package, azure-functions-core-tools@3 for **Windows** and for **macOs** in  `~/.fx/bin/func`. </br> <br> • The  Azure Functions Core Tools NPM package in  `~/.fx/bin/func/node_modules/azure-functions-core-tools/bin` manages Azure Functions Core Tools binary. For Linux, the local debug terminates.|</br>
|Azure functions | Install Azure functions binding extensions defined in `api/extensions.csproj`|Limitation to be added|
|NPM packages| Install NPM packages for tab app, bot app, messaging extension app, and Azure functions|Limitation to be added|
|Azure functions | Install .NET Core SDK|<br> • If .NET Core SDK is not installed or the version  doesn't match the requirement, the toolkit installs .NET Core SDK for Windows and macOS in `~/.fx/bin/dotnet`.</br> <br> • For Linux, the local debug terminates.|</br>

Use the following .NET Core versions:

| Platform  | Software|
| --- | --- |
|Windows, macOs (x64), Linux | 3.1 (recommended), 5.0, 6.0 |
|macOs (arm64) |6.0 |


> [!NOTE]
> • If you don't have a development certificate for localhost installed in **Windows or macOS**, the tab prompts you to install it.</br>
> • Start Ngrok to create a HTTP tunnel for bot and messaging extension.


The following table lists the ports available for components:

| Component  | Port |
| --- | --- |
| Tab | 53000 |
| Bot or messaging extension | 3978 |
| Node inspector for bot or messaging extension | 9239 |
| Azure functions | 7071 |
| Node inspector for Azure functions | 9229 |

> [!NOTE]
> If tab, bot, messaging extension, and Azure functions ports are unavailable, the local debug terminates.

When you Select **Start Debugging (F5)**. The Teams Toolkit output channel displays the progress and result after checking the prerequisites.

## Registrations and configurations

In the set up process, Teams Toolkit prepares the following registrations and configurations:

1. [Registers and configures Azure AD application](#registers-and-configures-azure-ad-application): Teams Toolkit registers and configures your Azure AD application.

1. [Registers and configures bot](#registers-and-configures-bot): Teams Toolkit registers and configures your bot.

1. [Registers and configures Teams app](#registers-and-configures-teams-app): Teams Toolkit registers and configures your Teams app.

### Registers and configures Azure AD application

1. Registers an Azure AD application.

1. Creates a Client Secret.

1. Exposes an API.

    a. Configures Application ID URI. For tab, `api://localhost/{appId}`. For bot or messaging extension,  `api://botid-{botid}`.

    b. Adds a scope named `access_as_user`. Enables it for **Admin and users**.

The following table lists the configurations of Microsoft 365 client application with their client Ids:

| Microsoft 365 client application |  Client ID  |
| --- | --- |
| Teams desktop, mobile | 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 |

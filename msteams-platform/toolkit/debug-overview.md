# Debug your Teams app

Teams Toolkit helps you to debug and preview your Microsoft Teams app. Debug is the process of checking, detecting, and correcting issues or bugs to ensure the program runs successfully in Teams.

::: zone pivot="visual-studio-code"

## Debug your Teams app for Visual Studio Code

Teams Toolkit in Microsoft Visual Studio Code automates the debug process. You can detect errors and fix them as well as preview the teams app. You can also customize debug settings to create your tab or bot.

## Debug your Microsoft Teams app for Visual Studio Code

Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code automates the debug process. You can detect errors and fix them as well as preview the teams app. You can also customize debug settings to create your tab or bot.

During the debug process:

* Teams Toolkit automatically starts app services, launches debuggers, and sideloads the Teams app.
* Teams Toolkit checks the prerequisites during the debug background process.
* Your Teams app is available for preview in Teams web client locally after debugging.
* You can also customize debug settings to use your bot endpoints, development certificate, or debug partial component to load your configured app.
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code allows you to debug tab, bot, message extension, and Azure Functions.

## Key debug features of Teams Toolkit

Teams Toolkit supports the following debug features:

* [Start debugging](#start-debugging)
* [Multi-target debugging](#multi-target-debugging)
* [Toggle breakpoints](#toggle-breakpoints)
* [Hot reload](#hot-reload)
* [Stop debugging](#stop-debugging)

Teams Toolkit performs background functions during debug process, which include verifying the prerequisites required for debug.You can see the progress of the verification process in the output channel of Teams Toolkit. In the setup process you can register and configure your Teams app.

### Start debugging

You can press **F5** as a single operation to start debugging. The Teams Toolkit starts to check prerequisites, registers Azure AD app, Teams app, and registers bot, starts services, and launches browser.

### Multi-target debugging

Teams Toolkit utilizes multi-target debugging feature to debug tab, bot, message extension, and Azure Functions at the same time.

### Toggle breakpoints

You can toggle breakpoints on the source codes of tabs, bots, message extensions, and Azure Functions. The breakpoints execute when you interact with the Teams app in a web browser. The following image shows toggle breakpoint:

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/toggle-points.png" alt-text="toggle breakpoints" lightbox="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/toggle-points.png":::

### Hot reload

You can update and save the source codes of tab, bot, message extension, and Azure Functions at the same time when you're debugging the Teams app. The app reloads and the debugger reattaches to the programming languages.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/hot-reload.png" alt-text="hot-reload for source codes" lightbox="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/hot-reload.png":::

### Stop debugging

When you complete local debug, you can select **Stop (Shift+F5)** or **[Alt] Disconnect (Shift+F5)** from the floating debugging toolbar to stop all debug sessions and terminate tasks. The following image shows the stop debug action:

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/stop-debug.png" alt-text="stop debugging":::

## Prepare for debug

The following steps help you to prepare for debug:

### Sign in to Microsoft 365

If you've signed up for Microsoft 365 already, sign in to Microsoft 365. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 developer program](tools-prerequisites.md#microsoft-365-developer-program)

### Toggle breakpoints

Ensure that you can toggle breakpoints on the source codes of tabs, bots, message extensions, and Azure Functions for more information, see [Toggle breakpoints](#toggle-breakpoints)

## Customize debug settings

Teams Toolkit unchecks some prerequisites and allows you to customize the debug settings to create your tab or bot.

 > [!NOTE]
 > Ensure to start a new local debug after you add new environment variables as the environment variables don't support hot reload.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Debug partial component</b></summary>

Teams Toolkit utilizes Visual Studio Code multi-target debugging to debug tab, bot, message extension, and Azure Functions at the same time. You can update `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` to debug partial component. If you want to debug tab only in a tab plus bot with Azure Functions project, use the following steps:

1. Comment **`Attach to Bot`** and **`Attach to Backend`** from debug compound in `.vscode/launch.json`.

   ```json
   {
       "name": "Debug (Edge)",
        "configurations": [
           "Attach to Frontend (Edge)",
           // "Attach to Bot",
           // "Attach to Backend""
           ],
           "preLaunchTask": "Pre Debug Check & Start All",
           "presentation": {
               "group": "all",
               "order": 1
           },
           "stopAll": true

   }
   ```

2. Comment **`Start Backend`** and Start Bot from Start All task in .vscode/tasks.json.

   ```json
   {
                                           
       "label": "Start All",
       "dependsOn": [
           "Start Frontend",
             // "Start Backend",
             // "Start Bot"

         ]
              
   }
   ```

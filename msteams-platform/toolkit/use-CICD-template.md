|Tools and Templates|Description|
|---|---|
|[teamsfx-cli-action](https://github.com/OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action)|A ready-to-use GitHub Action that integrates with TeamsFx CLI.|
|[github-ci-template.yml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/github-ci-template.yml) and [github-cd-template.yml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/github-cd-template.yml)| GitHub CI or CD templates for a Teams app. |
|[jenkins-ci-template.Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/jenkins-ci-template.Jenkinsfile) and [jenkins-cd-template.Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/jenkins-cd-template.Jenkinsfile)|Jenkins CI or CD templates for a Teams app.|
|[script-ci-template.sh](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-ci-template.sh) and [script-cd-template.sh](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-cd-template.sh)| Script templates for automation everywhere else outside of GitHub. |

## CI or CD workflow templates in GitHub

**To include CI or CD workflows to automate Teams app development process in GitHub**:

1. Create a folder under `.github/workflows`
1. Copy the template files (either one or both of them):
    * [github-ci-template.yml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/github-ci-template.yml) for CI workflow.
    * [github-cd-template.yml](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/github-cd-template.yml) for CD workflow.
1. Customize these workflows to fit your scenarios.

### Customize CI workflow

You can make the following changes to adapt the workflow for your project:

1. Change how the CI flow is triggered. We default to when a pull request is created targeting the `dev` branch.
1. Use a npm build script, or customize the way you build the project in the automation code.
1. Use a npm test script which returns zero for success, and/or change the test commands.

### Customize CD workflow

The following steps to customize CD workflow:

1. By default, the CD workflow is triggered, when new commits are made to the `main` branch.
1. Create GitHub [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) by environment to hold Azure service principal credentials. The following table lists all the secrets you need to create on GitHub, and for detailed usage, please refer to the GitHub Actions [README.md](https://github.com/OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action/blob/main/README.md).
1. Change the build scripts if necessary.
1. Remove the test scripts if you don't have tests.

> [!Note]
> The provision step is not included in the CD template as it's usually executed only once. You can either execute provision Within Teams Toolkit, TeamsFx CLI, or using a separated workflow. Please remember to commit after provisioning (results of provisioning will be deposited inside the `.fx` folder) and save the file content of `.fx/states/{YOUR_ENV_NAME}.userdata` into GitHub [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) with name `USERDATA_CONTENT` for future usage.

### Github secrets

Steps to create secrets by environment in GitHub:

1. In the project **Settings** page, navigate to **Environments** section and select **New environment**.
1. Enter a name for your environment. The default environment name provided in the template is `test_environment`. Select **Configure environment** to proceed.
1. In the next page, Select **Add Secret** to add secrets for each of the items listed in the table below.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
| AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME|The service principal name of Azure used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD|The password of Azure service principal.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisioned.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|

For more information on Azure service principals, see [Create Azure service principles](#create-azure-service-principles).

## Set up CI or CD Pipelines with Azure DevOps

You can set up automated pipelines in Azure DevOps, and make a reference on the scripts. Follow the steps given below to get started:

* [CI Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-ci-template.sh)
* [CD Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-cd-template.sh)

### Set up CI Pipeline

1. Add [CI Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-ci-template.sh) into your Azure DevOps repository, and do necessary customizations as you may infer from the comments in the script file.
1. Follow the [steps to create your Azure DevOps Pipeline for CI](/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline).
Here is an scenario of a common CI pipeline scripts:

```yml
trigger:
- dev 

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.17.0'
    checkLatest: true
  
- task: Bash@3
  inputs:
    filePath: './others-script-ci-template.sh'
```

The potential changes you can make for the script or workflow definition:

1. Change how the CI flow is triggered. We default to when a new commit is pushed into the `dev` branch.
1. Change the way of how to install node and npm.
1. Use npm build script, or customize the way you build in the automation code.
1. Use npm test script which returns zero for success, and/or change the test commands.

### Set up CD Pipeline

1. Add [CD Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-cd-template.sh) into your Azure DevOps repository, and do necessary customizations as you may infer from the comments in the script file.
1. Create your Azure DevOps Pipeline for CD, as you may refer to [this link](/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline). The Pipeline's definition can be referred to the following example definition for CI Pipeline.
1. Add necessary variables by [Define variables](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables), and make them as secrets if necessary.

```yml
trigger:
- main 

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.17.0'
    checkLatest: true

- task: DownloadSecureFile@1
  name: userdata
  inputs:
    secureFile: 'staging.userdata'
- task: Bash@3
  inputs:
    targetType: 'inline'
    script: |
      mkdir -p .fx/states/
      cp $(userdata.secureFilePath) .fx/states/staging.userdata
  
- task: Bash@3
  env:
    SP_NAME: $(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME)
    SP_PASSWORD: $(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD)
    TENANT_ID: $(AZURE_TENANT_ID)
  inputs:
    filePath: './others-script-cd-template.sh'
```

The potential changes you can make for the script or workflow definition:

1. How the CD flow is triggered. By default it happens when new commits are made to the **main** branch.
1. Change the way of how to install node and npm.
1. Change the environment name, by default its **staging**.
1. Ensure you have a npm build script, or customize the way you build in the automation code.
1. Ensure you have a npm test script which returns zero for success, and/or change the test commands.

> [!Note]
> The provision step is not included in the CD template as it's usually executed only once. You can either execute provision Within Teams Toolkit, TeamsFx CLI, or using a separated workflow. Please remember to commit after provisioning (results of provisioning will be deposited inside the `.fx` folder) and upload `.fx/states/{YOUR_ENV_NAME}.userdata` into Azure DevOps [secure files](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files) for future usage.

### Pipeline variables for Azure DevOps

Steps to create Pipeline variables in Azure DevOps:

1. In the Pipeline editing page, select **Variables** on top right and select **New variable**.
1. Enter Name/Value pair for your variable.
1. Toggle the checkbox of **Keep this value secret** if necessary.
1. Select **OK** to create the variable.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME|The service principal name of Azure used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD|The password of Azure service principal.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisioned.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|

For more information on Azure service principals, see [Create Azure service principles](#create-azure-service-principles)

## CI or CD Pipeline Templates in Jenkins

To add these templates to your repository, you will need your versions of [jenkins-ci-template.Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/jenkins-ci-template.Jenkinsfile) and  [jenkins-cd-template.Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/jenkins-cd-template.Jenkinsfile) to be located in your repository by branch.

Also, you need to create CI or CD pipelines in Jenkins which point to the specific **Jenkinsfile** correspondingly.

Follow the steps to check how to connect Jenkins with different SCM platforms:

1. [Jenkins with GitHub](https://www.jenkins.io/solutions/github/)
2. [Jenkins with Azure DevOps](https://www.dragonspears.com/blog/ci-cd-with-jenkins-and-azure-devops-services)
3. [Jenkins with GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jenkins.html)
4. [Jenkins with Bitbucket](https://medium.com/ampersand-academy/integrate-bitbucket-jenkins-c6e51103d0fe)

### Customize CI Pipeline

There are some potential changes you can make to adapt your project:

1. Rename the template file to **Jenkinsfile** since it's a common practice, and put it under the target branch, for example, the **dev** branch.
1. Change how the CI flow is triggered. We default to use the triggers of **pollSCM** when a new change is pushed into the **dev** branch.
1. Ensure you have a npm build script, or customize the way you build in the automation code.
1. Ensure you have a npm test script which returns zero for success, and/or change the test commands.

### Customize CD Pipeline

Change the following steps to customize CD pipeline:

1. Rename the template file to **Jenkinsfile** since it's a common practice, and put it under the target branch, for example, the **main** branch.
1. How the CD flow is triggered. We default to use the triggers of **pollSCM** when a new change is pushed into the **main** branch.
1. Create Jenkins [pipeline credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/) to hold Azure/Microsoft 365 login credentials. The table below lists all the credentials you need to create on Jenkins.
1. Change the build scripts if necessary.
1. Remove the test scripts if you don't have tests.

> [!Note]
 The provision step is not included in the CD template as it's usually executed only once. You can either execute provision Within Teams Toolkit, TeamsFx CLI, or using a separated workflow. Please remember to commit after provisioning (results of provisioning will be deposited inside the `.fx` folder) and save the file content of `.fx/states/{YOUR_ENV_NAME}.userdata` into Jenkins credentials for future usage.

### Environment variables for Jenkins

Follow [using-credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/) to create credentials on Jenkins.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME|The account name of Azure that is used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of Azure account.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisioned.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|
|Microsoft 365_ACCOUNT_NAME|The M3icrosoft 365 account for creating and publishing the Teams App.|
|Microsoft 365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of the Microsoft 365 account.|
|Microsoft 365_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the Teams App will be created/published. This value is optional unless you have a multi-tenant account and you want to use another tenant. Read more on [how to find your Microsoft 365 tenant ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant).|
> Note: Please refer to the [Configure Microsoft 365/Azure Credentials](https://github.com/OfficeDev/teamsfx-cli-action/blob/main/README.md#configure-m365azure-credentials-as-github-secret) to make sure you have disabled Multi-factor Authentication and Security Defaults for the credentials used in the pipeline.

## Get started guide for other platforms

You can follow the listed pre-defined example bash scripts to build and customize CI or CD pipelines on other platforms:

* [CI Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-ci-template.sh)
* [CD Scripts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/docs/cicd_insider/others-script-cd-template.sh)
The scripts are pretty straightforward and most parts of them are cross-platform CLI, so it's easy to transform them to other types of script, for example, PowerShell.

The scripts are based on a cross-platform TeamsFx command line tool [TeamsFx-CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teamsfx-cli). You can install it with `npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli` and follow the [documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/docs/cli/user-manual.md) to customize the scripts.

> [!Note]
> To enable `@microsoft/teamsfx-cli` running in CI mode, turn on `CI_ENABLED` by `export CI_ENABLED=true`. In CI mode, `@microsoft/teamsfx-cli` is friendly for CI or CD.

Ensure to set Azure and M365 credentials in your environment variables safely. For example if you are using GitHub as your source code repository, you can use the [Github Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to securely store your environment variables.

## Create Azure service principles

To provision and deploy resources targeting Azure inside CI/CD, you must create an Azure service principal for use.

The following are the steps used to create Azure service principles:

1. Register an Azure AD application in single tenant, and it requires sufficient permissions in your Azure AD tenant.
2. Assign a role to your Azure AD application to access your Azure subscription, and `Contributor` role is recommended.
3. Create a new Azure AD application secret.
4. Grab your tenant id, application id(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME), and the secret(AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD) for use. 

For detailed guidelines, refer to [the official document][/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal). There're three ways to create service principal:

* [Azure portal][/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)

* [PowerShell][/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell)

* [Azure CLI][/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli)

## Publish Teams app using Teams Developer Portal

If there's any changes related to Teams app's manifest file, you may want to publish the Teams app again to update the manifest.

To publish Teams app manually, you may leverage [Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home).

**To publish your app**

1. Sign in [Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com) using the corresponding account.
2. Import your app package in zip by selecting `App -> Import app -> Replace`.
3. Select the target app in app list, and you will go to the overview page.
4. Publish your app by selecting `Publish -> Publish to your org`

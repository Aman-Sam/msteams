# Toggle breakpoints

In Visual Studio Code, you canÂ toggle breakpoints on the source codes of tabs, bots, messaging extensions, and Azure functions. The breakpoints will be hit when you interact with the Teams app in a web browser.

## Hot reload

When you are debugging the Teams app, you can update the source codes of tab, bot, messaging extension and Azure functions at the same time. Update the codes and save the changes. The project will be re-loaded and the debugger will be re-attached no matter whether its programming language is JavaScript or TypeScript.

### Stop debugging

When you complete local debug, you can select **Stop or Disconnect** button in the floating debugging toolbar. All debug sessions will be stopped and all tasks will be terminated. Then It is safe to run local debug again.

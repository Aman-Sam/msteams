# Deploy Teams app to the cloud using Visual Studio

Teams Toolkit helps you to deploy or upload your application's front-end and back-end code to the provisioned cloud resources in your Azure subscription. The following apps can be deployed in Visual Studio:

* The tab app, such as frontend applications are deployed to Azure storage, configured for static web hosting.
* The notification bot app with Azure function triggers can be deployed to Azure functions.
* The bot app or message extension can be deployed to Azure app services.

## Prerequisite

* Install Visual Studio.
* Install Teams Toolkit.
* Create the Azure cloud resources to host your Microsoft Teams app from your project in Visual Studio.

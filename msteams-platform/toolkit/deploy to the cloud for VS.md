# Deploy Teams app to the cloud for Visual Studio

Teams Toolkit helps you to deploy or upload your application frontend and backend code to the provisioned cloud resources in your Azure subscription.

* The tab, such as frontend applications are deployed to Azure storage and configured for static web hosting.
* The Notification Bot with Azure function triggers is deployed to Azure functions.
* The bot or message extension is deployed to Azure app service.

## Prerequisite

* Install Teams Toolkit
* Create the Azure cloud resources to host your Teams app by right clicking on your project

> [!NOTE]
> Before you deploy project code to cloud, [provision the cloud resources](provision.md).

## Deploy Teams apps using Teams Toolkit

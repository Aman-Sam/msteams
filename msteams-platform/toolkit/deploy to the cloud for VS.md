# Deploy Teams app to the cloud in Visual Studio

Microsoft Teams Toolkit helps you to deploy or upload your applications front-end and back-end code to the provisioned cloud resources in your Azure subscription. The following apps can be deployed in Visual Studio:

* The tab such as frontend applications are deployed to Azure storage, configured for static web hosting.
* The Notification Bot app with Azure function triggers can be deployed to Azure functions.
* The bot app or message extension can be deployed to Azure app service.

## Prerequisite

* Install Visual Studio.
* Install Teams Toolkit.
* Create the Azure cloud resources to host your Teams app from your project in Visual Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you deploy project code to cloud, [provision the cloud resources](provision.md).

## Deploy Teams app using Teams Toolkit

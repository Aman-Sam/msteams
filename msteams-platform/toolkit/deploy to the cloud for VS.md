# Deploy Teams app to the cloud for Visual Studio

Microsoft Teams Toolkit helps you to deploy or upload your applications front-end and back-end code to the provisioned cloud resources in your Azure subscription.

* The tab, such as frontend applications are deployed to Azure storage and configured for static web hosting.
* The Notification Bot with Azure function triggers is deployed to Azure functions.
* The bot or message extension is deployed to Azure app service.

## Prerequisite

* Install Visual Studio.
* Install Teams Toolkit.
* Create the Azure cloud resources to host your Teams app from your project in Visual Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you deploy project code to cloud, [provision the cloud resources](provision.md).

## Deploy Teams apps using Teams Toolkit

1. Launch Visual Studio and open an existing or create a new project.
2. Right click on your **project** under **Solution Explorer panel**, select **Teams Toolkit** > **Deploy to the cloud â€¦**.

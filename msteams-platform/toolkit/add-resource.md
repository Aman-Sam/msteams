# Add cloud resources to your Teams app

TeamsFx helps to provision cloud resources for your application hosting. You can also optionally add cloud resources that fits your development needs.

## Prerequisite

* [Install Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) version v3.0.0+.

> [!TIP]
> You should already have a Teams app project.

## Add cloud resources using Teams Toolkit

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to provision each environment after you add a resource.

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
1. Select **Teams Toolkit** from left panel:

    ![Activate Teams Toolkit](./images/activate-teams-toolkit.png)

1. In the Teams Toolkit side bar panel, select **Add cloud resources**:

    ![Add cloud resources](./images/add-cloud-resources.png)

    You can also open the command palette and enter **Teams: Add cloud resources**:
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Follow the same process as itâ€™s triggered from Tree View:

    ![Alternate cloud resources](./images/alternate-cloud-resources.png)

1. From the pop-up, select any cloud resources you want to add to your Teams app project:

     ![Select cloud resources](./images/select-cloud-resources.png)

1. Select **OK**.

## Add cloud resources using TeamsFx CLI in Command Window

1. Change directory to your **project directory**.
1. Execute command to add different capabilities.

The following table describes cloud resources and the corresponding commands to add them:

|Cloud Resources|Command|
|---------------|----------|
| Azure function|`teamsfx resource add azure-function --function-name your-func-name`|
| Azure SQL database|`teamsfx resource add --function-name your-func-name`|
| Azure API management|`teamsfx resource add azure-apim`|
| Azure Key Vault|`teamsfx resource add azure-keyvault`|

## What cloud resources can be added

TeamsFx provides seamless integrations with Azure services that are common for the following application scenarios:

- [Azure functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview): A serverless solution to meet your on-demand requirements, such as creating web APIs for your Teams applications backend.
- [Azure SQL database](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview): A fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) database engine to serve as your Teams applications data store.
- [Azure API management](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview): An API gateway that can be used to administer APIs created for Teams applications and publish them to consume on other applications, such as Power Apps.
- [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview): Safeguard cryptographic keys and other secrets used by cloud apps and services.

## What happens when you add resources

The following changes will happen to your project when you add any resources:

- New parameters may be added to azure.parameter.{env}.json to provide required information for provision.
- New content are appended to ARM template under `templates/azure` folder (except files under `templates/azure/teamsfx` folder) to create the added Azure resources.
- Files under `templates/azure/teamsfx` folder are regenerated to ensure TeamsFx required configuration are up-to-date for added Azure resources.
- `.fx/projectSettings.json` is updated to track the resources present in your project.

In the meanwhile, there're some additional changes for each kind of resource:

|Resources Added|What changed|Why these changes are made|
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
|Azure Functions|An Azure Functions template code is added into a subfolder with path `yourProjectFolder/api`</br></br>`launch.json` and `task.json` updated under `.vscode` folder.| Include a hello world http trigger template into your project.</br></br> To include necessary scripts for Visual Studio Code executed when you want to debug your application locally.|
|Azure API Management|An Open API Specification file added into a subfolder with path `yourProjectFolder/openapi`|This is the API specification file defines your API after publishing.|

## Limitations

- You can only add one Function App / Azure SQL Database / APIM Service to your project.
- You cannot add resources if your project does not contain tab app.

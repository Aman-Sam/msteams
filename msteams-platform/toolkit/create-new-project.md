## Output directory structure for different app types

Teams Toolkit provides all components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code.

There are two different types of app

* Basic Teams app
  * Tab
  * Bot
  * Message extension

* Scenario based Teams app
  * Notification bot
  * Command bot
  * SSO-enabled tab
  * SPFx tab

The following is the directory structure for Basic Teams app, Tab app:

<details>
<summary><b>Tab app</b></summary>

| Folder name | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `.fx/configs` | Configuration files that user can customize for the Teams app. |
| - `.fx/configs/config.<envName>.json` | Configuration file for every environment. |
| - `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.<envName>.json` | Parameters file for Azure BICEP provision for every environment. |
| - `.fx/configs/projectSettings.json` | Global project settings that apply to all environments. |
| - `.fx/states` | Provision output that is generated by Teams Toolkit.  The toolkit creates this folder after you provision resources for your app. |
| - `.fx/states/state.<envName>.json` | Provision output file for every environment. |
| - `.fx/states/<env>.userdata` | Sensitive user data for the provision output for every environment. |
| `tabs` | Code for the Tab capability needed at runtime, such as the privacy notice, terms of use, and configuration tabs. |
| - `tabs/src/index.jsx` | Entry point for the front-end app, where the main App component is rendered with `ReactDOM.render()` |
| - `tabs/src/components/App.jsx` | Code for handling URL routing in the app. It calls the [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](../msteams-platform/tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-sdk.md) to establish communication between your app and Teams. |
| - `tabs/src/components/Tab.jsx` | Code to implement the UI of your app. |
| - `tabs/src/components/TabConfig.jsx` | Code to implement the UI that configures your app. |
| `templates/appPackage` | App manifest template files, and the app icons: color.png and outline.png. |
| - `templates/appPackage/manifest.template.json` | App manifest for running the app in local or remote environment.  |
| `templates/azure` | BICEP template files |

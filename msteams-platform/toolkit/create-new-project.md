# Create a new Teams app using Teams Toolkit

You can build a new Teams app by using **Create a new Teams app** in Teams Toolkit. You can create basic Teams app and scenario based Teams app in Teams Toolkit.

In basic Teams app, we have following types of app

* Tab
* Bot
* Message extension

In scenario based Teams app, we have following types of app

* Notification bot
* Command bot
* SSO-enabled tab
* SPFx tab

1. Select at least one option to start creating the Teams app.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For SPFx, follow the same steps to create a new Teams app and you need to select Framework and Web Part Name as well. For more information, see [Build a Teams app with SPFx](../sbs-gs-spfx.yml).

## Directory structure for different app types

Teams Toolkit provides all components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code.

Directory structure for basic Teams app

<details>
<summary><b>Tab app</b></summary>

| Folder name | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `.fx/configs` | Configuration files that user can customize for the Teams app. |
| - `.fx/configs/config.<envName>.json` | Configuration file for every environment. |
| - `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.<envName>.json` | Parameters file for Azure BICEP provision for every environment. |
| - `.fx/configs/projectSettings.json` | Global project settings that apply to all environments. |
| - `.fx/states` | Provision output that is generated by Teams Toolkit.  The toolkit creates this folder after you provision resources for your app. |
| - `.fx/states/state.<envName>.json` | Provision output file for every environment. |
| - `.fx/states/<env>.userdata` | Sensitive user data for the provision output for every environment. |
| `tabs` | Code for the Tab capability needed at runtime, such as the privacy notice, terms of use, and configuration tabs. |
| - `tabs/src/index.jsx` | Entry point for the front-end app, where the main App component is rendered with `ReactDOM.render()` |
| - `tabs/src/components/App.jsx` | Code for handling URL routing in the app. It calls the [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](../tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-sdk.md) to establish communication between your app and Teams. |
| - `tabs/src/components/Tab.jsx` | Code to implement the UI of your app. |
| - `tabs/src/components/TabConfig.jsx` | Code to implement the UI that configures your app. |
| `templates/appPackage` | App manifest template files, and the app icons: color.png and outline.png. |
| - `templates/appPackage/manifest.template.json` | App manifest for running the app in local or remote environment.  |
| `templates/azure` | BICEP template files |

Directory structure updated with app features

You can add additional features to your existing Teams app by using add features. For example, if you add bot app to the existing tab app. Bot folder is added with files and codes relevant to bot.

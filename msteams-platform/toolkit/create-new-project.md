# Create a new Teams app using Teams Toolkit

To create new Teams app using Teams Toolkit, select **Create a new Teams app** or **View samples**.

Select Create a new Teams app and choose from the capabilities available - tab, bot, messaging extension, or a tab using SharePoint Framework (SPFx). Select at least one option to start creating and add more capabilities as per the requirement of the Teams app.

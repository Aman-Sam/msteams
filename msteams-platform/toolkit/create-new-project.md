# Create a new Teams app using Teams Toolkit

Visual Studio code allows you to create a new Teams app using Teams Toolkit. After installing Teams Toolkit extension, you will see the Teams Toolkit icon in the sidebar :::image type="icon" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/manual/toolkit-icon.png" border="false":::. Select any one of the following options:

 1. Open **Teams Toolkit** from Visual Studio Code.
 1. Select **DEVELOPMENT** section in Treeview.
 1. Select **View samples**. The sample gallery appears as shown in the following image:

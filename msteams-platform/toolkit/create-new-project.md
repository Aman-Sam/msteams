Select **Create a new Teams app** and choose from the capabilities available - tab, bot, messaging extension, or a tab using SharePoint Framework (SPFx).

## Create a new Teams app using sample code

You can create a new project by exploring the **View samples** and choosing an existing sample for your new app. These samples may already have some functionality, for example a todo list with an Azure backend, or an integration with the Microsoft Graph Toolkit. Follow these steps to create an app from one of the samples. If there are no open folders in Visual Studio Code, proceed with second step.

 1. Open **Teams Toolkit** from Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
 1. Select **DEVELOPMENT** section in Tree View.
 1. Select **View samples**. The sample gallery appears as shown in the following image:

You can explore and download samples and either run apps locally or remotely to preview in the Teams web client. Follow the instructions for each sample, or  choose **View on GitHub** to open the sample within the TeamsFx-Samples repository and browse the source code.

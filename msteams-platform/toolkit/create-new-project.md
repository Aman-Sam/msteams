# Create a new Teams app using Teams Toolkit

To create new Teams app using Teams Toolkit, you can select from one of the options **Create a new Teams app** or **View samples**.

## Create a new Teams app

To create a new Teams app using the Teams Toolkit, open Visual Studio Code and select **Create a new Teams app** option. Select from the capabilities available - tab, bot, messaging extension, or a tab using SharePoint Framework (SPFx). Select at least one option to start creating, and then add more capabilities as needed, according to the requirements of the Teams app.

The following guides help you to scaffold a new Teams starter app using each of them:

## Create a new Teams app using sample code

You can create a new app by exploring the **View samples** and choosing an existing sample for your new app. These samples may already have some functionality, for example a todo list with an Azure backend, or an integration with the Microsoft Graph Toolkit. 

Follow these steps to create an app from one of the samples. If there are no open folders in Visual Studio Code, proceed with second step.

 1. Open **Teams Toolkit** from Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
 1. Select **DEVELOPMENT** section in Tree View.
 1. Select **View samples**. The sample gallery appears as shown in the following image:

You can explore and download samples and either run apps locally or remotely to preview in the Teams web client. Follow the instructions for each sample, or  choose **View on GitHub** to open the sample within the TeamsFx-Samples repository and browse the source code.

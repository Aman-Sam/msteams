   The bot uses Teams API to send and receive files with users in the personal chats. The files shared in Teams can appear as cards and allow rich in-app viewing. The bot also helps in implementing features like expense reporting, image recognition, file archival, and e-signatures that involve editing of file content. 
   
   **Key features of uploading file in Teams using bot:** 
   
     * Upload files to Teams using a bot.
     * Receive a file sent to bot as an attachment.
     * Fetch inline images sent in message.

    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment: 

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call-all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
   
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    The most comprehensive way to test your app is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is the only way to test the full functionality available to your app,
    across all scopes. You can configure and run the Teams app by uploading the manifest.zip file.

    To run the Teams file bot you need to upload the manifest.zip file in Teams.

    1. In the Windows Explorer, go to botbuilder-samples > samples > csharp_dotnetcore > 56.teams-file-upload > TeamsAppManifest-folder.
    
    2. Open the manifest.json file in visual studio code.

    3. In the manifest.json file, find YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID and replace it with your App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) every where you see the place holder string and save it.
       (Image needs to be added) 

    4. Zip up the contents of the `TeamsAppManifest' folder to create **manifest.zip**.

    5. Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

    6. To upload **manifest.zip**, select **Store > Manage your apps > Upload a custom app** and open **manifest.zip**.

    7. Select **Add** to add the bot to your chat.

    1. Sending a message to the bot will cause it to respond with a card that will prompt you to upload a file. The file that's being uploaded is the teams-logo.png in the Files directory in this sample. 
    The Accept and Decline events illustrated in this sample are specific to Teams. You can message the bot again to receive another prompt.

    2. You can send a file to the bot as an attachment in the message compose section in Teams. This will be delivered to the bot as a Message Activity and the code in this sample fetches and saves the file.

    3. You can also send an inline image in the message compose section. This will be present in the attachments of the Activity and requires the Bot's access token to fetch the image.

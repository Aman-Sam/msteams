   The bot is created using Bot Framework. It shows how to upload files to Teams from a bot and how to receive a file sent to a bot as an attachment. 
   It also shows how to fetch inline images sent in message.
    
   This step-by-step guide helps you to upload files from a bot to Microsoft Teams. You'll see the following output:

    To set up your development environment, install the following tools:

    * Microsoft Teams and a Teams account.
    * [.NET Core SDK version 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
    * [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or an equivalent tunnelling solution.
    * Visual Studio 2019 or later.

    To authenticate the bot, you can set up bot in Azure Bot Service. Register bot with Azure Bot Service when you develop and host it in Azure. Perform the following steps:
    
    1. Configure and run your Teams file bot app.
    1. Create Azure Bot resource.
    1. Create client secret.
    1. Add Microsoft Teams channel.
    1. Add messaging endpoint.
    
    **To configure and run your Teams file bot app:**
    
    1. Open a command prompt and clone the repository at https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git. Note the path where you clone the repository.
    
    1. In Visual Studio:

        * Open Visual Studio.
        * Select **File** > **Open** > **Project/Solution**.
        * Access `botbuilder-samples\samples\csharp_dotnetcore\56.teams-file-upload` folder.
        * Open the `Teamsfileupload.csproj` file.

    1. Open ngrok terminal and start a ngrok tunnel with this command `ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978`.

    **To create Azure Bot resource:**

    1. Access the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    1. Select **Create a resource**.
    1. In the search box, enter **Azure bot** and select the Enter key.
    1. Select **Azure Bot**.

         ![Create Azure bot card](~/assets/images/teams-file-upload-bot/azure-new.png)

    1. Select **Create**.
    1. Enter required bot handle name in **Bot handle**.
    1. From the **Subscription** dropdown list, select the subscription.

         ![Messaging end point](~/assets/images/teams-file-upload-bot/messaging-endpoint.png)

    1. Select **Apply**.

       You have successfully set up a bot in Azure Bot Service and now you need to set up bot service connection.

    1. Select **Save**.

- title: Test your app
  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |
    The most comprehensive way to test your app is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is the only way to test the full functionality available to your app,
    across all scopes. You can configure and run the Teams app by uploading the `manifest.zip` file.

    To execute the Teams file bot, upload the `manifest.zip` file in Teams. Perform the following steps:

    1. In the **File Explorer**, go to **botbuilder-samples** > **samples** > **csharp_dotnetcore** > **56.teams-file-upload** > **appsettings**.

    1. Open the appsettings in Visual Studio Code and update the `appsettings.json` configuration file for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId (Bot Id)`, `MicrosoftAppPassword(Value of the client secret ID)`, `MicrosoftAppType`, and `MicrosoftAppTenantID`.

       ![app settings](~/assets/images/teams-file-upload-bot/app-settings.png)

    1. Open the `manifest.json` file in Visual Studio Code.

    1. In the `manifest.json` file, locate `YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID` and replace it with your App Id. Your App ID is created when you register your bot. Save the file.

       ![manifest json](~/assets/images/teams-file-upload-bot/manifest-json.png)

    1. Zip up the contents of the `TeamsAppManifest' folder to create a `manifest.zip` archive. Open the manifest file in Visual Studio Code and replace with your MicrosoftAppID (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json` file.)

    1. Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

    1. To upload `manifest.zip`, select **Store** > **Manage your apps** > **Upload a custom app** and open `manifest.zip`.

    1. Select **Add** to add the bot to your chat.

    1. Before sending a message to the bot, go to **File Explorer**, navigate to **botbuilder-samples** > **samples** > **csharp_dotnetcore** > **56.teams-file-upload**

    1. Open `TeamsFileUpload.csproj` file in Visual Studio Code and ensure you are in 'Teams file upload'

        ![Visual code](~/assets/images/teams-file-upload-bot/visual-studio-teams-file-upload-bot.png)

    1. Run your bot, from Visual Studio with `F5` or using `dotnet run` in the appropriate folder

    1. Send a message `Hi` to the bot and wait for few seconds for it to respond with a card.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  After the bot is installed in the personal scope, the user enters into a one on one chat conversation with the bot.

    This guide shows how to communicate with the bot in various ways. Following are the steps that demonstrates the bot activities:

    1. Send a message to the bot. It responds with a card for the permission to upload the file.
       
         ![prompt1](~/assets/images/teams-file-upload-bot/sbs-1.png)

    1. Select **Allow**. A `teams-logo.png` file is uploaded to the file directory, which is ready to download.

         ![message prompt](~/assets/images/teams-file-upload-bot/sbs-2.png)

    1. Send a file to the bot as an attachment in Teams. It responds with a message `Received and Saved`. You can view the attachment from the **Files** tab.

         ![file prompt](~/assets/images/teams-file-upload-bot/sbs-3.png)

    1. Send an image as an attachment. It responds with a message `Received and saved`. You can view the image on the chat window and from **Files** tab.

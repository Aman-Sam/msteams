# Create a channel or group tab

Channel or group tabs deliver content to channels and group chats, and are a great way to create collaborative spaces around dedicated web-based content.

Choose your environment to build channel or group tab from **Node.js**, **ASP.NET Core**, or **ASP.NET Core MVC**.

## Create a custom channel or group tab

# [Node.js](#tab/nodejs)

### Create a custom channel or group tab with Node.js

To create custom channel and group tab with Node.js:

1. In a command prompt, install the [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and [gulp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) packages by entering the following command after installing the **Node.js**:

    ```cmd
    npm install yo gulp-cli --global
    ```

2. Install the Microsoft Teams App generator by entering the following command in your command prompt:

    ```cmd
    npm install generator-teams --global
    ```
### Generate your channel or group tab

1. At a command prompt, create a new directory for your channel or group tab.

1. To start the Microsoft Teams App generator, enter the following command in your new directory.

    ```cmd
    yo teams
    ```

1. Microsoft Teams App generator will prompt a series of questions as folowing to which by providing your values you update your **manifest.json** file:

    ![generator opening screenshot](/microsoftteams/platform/assets/images/tab-images/teamsTabScreenshot.PNG)

    **What is your solution name?**

    The solution name is your project name. You can accept the suggested name by selecting **Enter**.

    **Where do you want to place the files?**

    You're currently in your project directory. Select **Enter**.

    **Title of your Microsoft Teams app project?**

    The title is your app package name and is used in the app manifest and description. Enter a title or select **Enter** to accept the default name.

    **Your (company) name? (max 32 characters)**

    Your company name will be used in the app manifest. Enter a company name or select **Enter** to accept the default name.

    **Which manifest version would you like to use?**

    Select the default schema.

    **Quick scaffolding? (Y/n)**

    The default is yes; enter **n** to enter your Microsoft Partner ID.

    **Enter your Microsoft Partner Id, if you have one? (Leave blank to skip)**

    This field isn't required and must be used only if you're already part of the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com).

    **What do you want to add to your project?**

    Select **( &ast; ) A Tab**.

    **The URL where you will host this solution?**

    By default, the generator suggests an Azure Web Sites URL. You're only testing your app locally, so a valid URL isn't necessary.

    **Would you like show a loading indicator when your app/tab loads?**

    Choose **not** to include a loading indicator when your app or tab loads. The default is no, enter **n**.

    **Would you like personal apps to be rendered without a tab header-bar?**

    Choose **not** to include personal apps to be rendered without a tab header-bar. Default is no, enter **n**.

    **Would you like to include Test framework and initial tests? (y/N)**

    Choose **not** to include a test framework for this project. The default is no, enter **n**.

    **Would you like to include ESLint support? (y/N)**

    Choose not to include ESLint support. The default is no, enter **n**.

    **Would you like to use Azure Applications Insights for telemetry? (y/N)**

    Choose **not** to include [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview). The default is no; enter **n**.

    **Default Tab Name (max 16 characters)?**

    Name your tab. This tab name is used throughout your project as a file or URL path component.

    **What kind of Tab would you like to create?**

    Use the arrow keys to select **Configurable** tab.

    **What scopes do you intend to use for your Tab?**

    You can select a team or a group chat.

    **Do you require Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Single-Sign-On support for the tab?**

    Choose **not** to include Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Single-Sign-On support for the tab. The default is yes, enter **n**.

    **Do you want this tab to be available in SharePoint Online? (Y/n)**

    Enter **n**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** is the value that you entered in the generator for **Default Tab Name** plus the word **Tab**.
    >
    > For example: DefaultTabName is **MyTab** then **/MyTabTab/**

### Build and run your application

You must have an [app package](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md) to build and run your application in Teams.

#### Create the app package

The package is created through a gulp task that validates the **manifest.json** file and generates the zip folder in the **./package** directory. In the command prompt, enter the following command:

```cmd
gulp manifest
```

#### Build your application

The build command transpiles your solution into the **./dist** folder. Enter the following command in the command prompt:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. Start a local web server by entering the following in the command prompt:

    ```bash
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in your browser, replace **yourDefaultAppNameTab** with your tab name, and view your application's home page as shown in the following image:

    ![home page screenshot](~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png)

1. To view your tab configuration page, go to `https://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/config.html`. The following is shown:

    ![Configuration page screenshot](~/assets/images/tab-images/configurationPage.png)

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

To establish a secure tunnel to your tab, exit the localhost and enter the following command:

```cmd
gulp ngrok-serve
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After your tab has been uploaded to Microsoft Teams through **ngrok**, and successfully saved, you can view it in Teams until your tunnel session ends. If you restart your ngrok session, you must update your app with the new URL. 

### Upload your application to Teams

**To upload your application to Teams**

1. Go to Microsoft Teams. If you use the [web-based version](https://teams.microsoft.com) you can inspect your front-end code using your browser's [developer tools](~/tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md).
1. From your teams on the left pane, select the ellipses &#x25CF;&#x25CF;&#x25CF; next to the team that you are using to test your tab and choose **Manage team**.
1. In the main pane, select **Apps** from the tab bar and choose **Upload a custom app** located in the lower right corner of the page.
1. Go your project directory, browse to the **./package** folder, select the app package zip folder, and choose **Open**.

    ![Channel tab added](../../assets/images/tab-images/channeltabadded.png)

1. Select **Add** in the pop-up dialog box. Your tab uploads into Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> If  **Add** doesn't display in the dialog box then remove the following code from the manifest of the uploaded app package zip folder. Again zip the folder and upload it to Teams.
>"staticTabs": [],
>"bots": [],
>"connectors": [],
>"composeExtensions": [],

1. Return to your team, choose the channel where you want to display the tab, select âž• from the tab bar, and choose your tab from the gallery.
1. Follow the directions for adding a tab. There is a custom configuration dialog box for your channel or group tab.
1. Select **Save** and your tab is added to the channel's tab bar.

    ![Channel tab uploaded](../../assets/images/tab-images/channeltabuploaded.png)

# [ASP.NET Core](#tab/aspnetcore)

### Create a custom channel or group tab with ASP.NET Core

You can create a custom channel or group tab using C# and ASP.NET Core Razor pages. To create a channel or group tab with ASP.NET Core Razor pages:

1. At a command prompt, create a new directory for your tab project.

1. Clone the sample repository into your new directory using the following command or you can download the [source code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples) and extract the files:

    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

### Generate your personal tab

1. Open Visual Studio and select **Open a project or solution**.

1. Navigate to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples** > **samples** > **tab-channel-group** > **razor-csharp** folder and open **channelGroupTab.sln**.

In Visual Studio, press **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from your application's **Debug** menu to verify if the application has loaded properly. In a browser, go to the following URLs:

* http://localhost:3978/
* http://localhost:3978/personalTab
* http://localhost:3978/privacy
* http://localhost:3978/tou

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab for Teams

Microsoft Teams is a cloud-based product and requires that your tab content be available from the cloud using HTTPS endpoints. Teams does not allow local hosting. You must either publish your tab to a public URL, or use a proxy that exposes your local port to an internet-facing URL.

To test your tab, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs). Your server's web endpoints are available while ngrok is running on your computer. In the free version of ngrok, if you close ngrok, the URLs are different the next time you start it.

- At a command prompt in the root of your project directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    ngrok http https://localhost:44355 -host-header="localhost:44355"
    ```

- Ngrok listens to requests from the internet and routes them to your application when it is running on port 44355. It should resemble `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/` where **y8rCgT2b** is replaced by your ngrok alpha-numeric HTTPS URL.

- Ensure that you keep the command prompt with ngrok running and make a note of the URL.

### Update your application

Within **Tab.cshtml** the application presents the user with two option buttons for displaying the tab with either a red or gray icon. Choosing the **Select Gray** or **Select Red** button triggers `saveGray()` or `saveRed()`, respectively, sets `settings.setValidityState(true)`, and enables the **Save** button on the configuration page. This code lets Teams know that you have completed the configuration requirements and the installation can proceed. The parameters of `settings.setSettings` are set. Finally, `saveEvent.notifySuccess()` is called to indicate that the content URL has been successfully resolved.

#### _Layout.cshtml

For your tab to display in Teams, you must include the **Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK** and include a call to `microsoftTeams.initialize()` after your page loads. This is how your tab and the Teams client communicate:

Go to the **Shared** folder, open **_Layout.cshtml**, and add the following to the `<head>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/sdk/v1.6.0/js/MicrosoftTeams.min.js"></script>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not copy and paste the `<script src="...">` URLs from this page, as they do not represent the latest version. To get the latest version of the SDK, always go to [Microsoft Teams JavaScript API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js).

#### Tab.cshtml

**To update Tab.cshtml**

1. Open **Tab.cshtml** in Visual Studio and update the embedded `<script>`.

1. At the top of the script, call `microsoftTeams.initialize()`.

1. Update the `websiteUrl` and `contentUrl` values in each function with the HTTPS ngrok URL to your tab.

    Your code should now include the following with **y8rCgT2b** replaced with your ngrok URL:

    ```javascript
        microsoftTeams.initialize();

        let saveGray = () => {
            microsoftTeams.settings.registerOnSaveHandler(function (saveEvent) {
                microsoftTeams.settings.setSettings({
                    websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                    contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/gray/`,
                    entityId: "grayIconTab",
                    suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab"
                });
                saveEvent.notifySuccess();
            });
        }

        let saveRed = () => {
            microsoftTeams.settings.registerOnSaveHandler(function (saveEvent) {
                microsoftTeams.settings.setSettings({
                    websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                    contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/red/`,
                    entityId: "redIconTab",
                    suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab"
                });
                saveEvent.notifySuccess();
        });
        }
    ```

1. Save the updated **Tab.cshtml**.

### Build and run your application for Teams

**To build and run your application**

1. In Visual Studio, press **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu.
1. Verify that **ngrok** is running and working properly by opening your browser and going to your content page via the ngrok HTTPS URL that was provided in your command prompt window.

> [!TIP]
> You need to have both your application in Visual Studio and ngrok running to complete the steps provided in this article. If you need to stop running your application in Visual Studio to work on it, **keep ngrok running**. It listens and resumes routing your application's request when it restarts in Visual Studio. If you have to restart the ngrok service it returns a new URL and you have to update your application with the new URL.

### Upload your tab for Teams

> [!NOTE]
> App Studio can be used to edit your **manifest.json** file and upload the completed package to Teams. You can also manually edit the **manifest.json** file. If you do, ensure that you build the solution again to create the **tab.zip** file to upload.

**To upload your tab with App Studio**

1. Go to Microsoft Teams. If you use the [web-based version](https://teams.microsoft.com), you can inspect your front-end code using your browser's [developer tools](~/tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md).

1. Go to **App Studio** and select the **Manifest editor** tab.

1. Select **Import an existing app** in the **Manifest editor** to begin updating the app package for your tab. The source code comes with its own partially complete manifest. The name of your app package is **tab.zip**. It is available from the following path:

    ```bash
    /bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/tab.zip
    ```

1. Upload **tab.zip** to App Studio.

#### Update your app package with Manifest editor

After you have uploaded your app package into App Studio, you must configure it.

Select the tile for your newly imported tab in the right panel of the Manifest editor welcome page.

There is a list of steps on the left side of the Manifest editor, and on the right, a list of properties that must have values for each of those steps. Much of the information has been provided by your **manifest.json** but there are fields that you must update.

##### Details: App details

In the **App details** section:

1. Under **Identification**, select **Generate** to replace the placeholder ID with the required GUID for your tab.

1. Under **Developer information**, update **Website** with your **ngrok** HTTPS URL.

1. Under **App URLs**, update the **Privacy statement** to `https://<yourngrokurl>/privacy` and **Terms of use** to `https://<yourngrokurl>/tou`>.

##### Capabilities: Tabs

In the **Tabs** section:

1. Under **Team tab**, select **Add**.

1. In the **Team tab** pop-up window, update the **Configuration URL** to `https://<yourngrokurl>/tab`.

1. Ensure the **Can update configuration?**, **Team**, and **Group chat** checkboxes are selected and select **Save**.

##### Finish: Domains and permissions

In the **Domains and permissions** section, **Domains from your tabs** must contain your ngrok URL without the HTTPS prefix `<yourngrokurl>.ngrok.io/`.

##### Finish: Test and distribute

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On the right, in **Description**, you see the following warning:
>
> &#9888; "**The 'validDomains' array cannot contain a tunneling site...**"
>
> This warning can be ignored while testing your tab.

1. In the **Test and Distribute** section, select **Install**.

1. In the pop-up dialog box, select **Add to a team** or from the drop-down, select **Add to a chat**.

1. Choose the team or chat where you want the tab to be displayed and select **Set up a tab**.

1. In the next pop-up dialog box, choose either **Select Gray** or **Select Red**, and select **Save**.

1. To view your tab, go to the team or chat where you installed the tab, and select it from the tab bar. The page that you chose during configuration is displayed.

# [ASP.NET Core MVC](#tab/aspnetcoremvc)

### Create a custom channel or group tab with ASP.NET Core MVC

You can create a custom channel or group tab using C# and ASP.Net Core MVC. [App Studio for Microsoft Teams](~/concepts/build-and-test/app-studio-overview.md) is also used to finalize your app manifest and deploy your tab to Teams.

### Prerequisites for custom channel or group tab

- You must have a Microsoft 365 tenant and a team configured with **Allow uploading custom apps** enabled. For more information, see [prepare your Office 365 tenant](~/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not currently have a Microsoft 365 account, you can sign up for a free subscription through the [Microsoft Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program). The subscription remains active as long as you are using it for ongoing development.

- Use App Studio to import your application to Teams. To install App Studio, select **Apps** ![Store App](~/assets/images/tab-images/storeApp.png) at the lower left corner of the Teams app, and search for **App Studio**. After you find the tile, select it and choose **Add** in the pop-up dialog box to install it.

In addition, this project requires that you have the following installed in your development environment:

- The current version of the Visual Studio IDE with the **.NET CORE cross-platform development** workload installed. If you do not already have Visual Studio, you can download and install the latest [Microsoft Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) version for free.

- The [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) reverse proxy tool. Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly-available HTTPS endpoints. You can [download ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).

### Get the source code

At a command prompt, create a new directory for your tab project. A simple [Channel Group Tab](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-sample-tabs/tree/master/ChannelGroupTabMVC) project is provided to get you started. Clone the sample repository into your new directory using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-sample-tabs.git
```

Alternately, you can retrieve the source code by downloading the zip folder and extracting the files.

**To build and run the tab project**

1. After you have the source code, go to Visual Studio and select **Open a project or solution**.
1. Go to the tab application directory and open **ChannelGroupTabMVC.sln**.
1. To build and run your application, press **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu.
1. In a browser, navigate to the following URLs and verify that the application loaded properly:

    - `http://localhost:44360`
    - `http://localhost:44360/privacy`
    - `http://localhost:44360/tou`

### Review the source code

#### Startup.cs

This project was created from an ASP.NET Core 2.2 Web Application empty template with the **Advanced - Configure for HTTPS** check box selected at setup. The MVC services are registered by the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, the empty template does not enable serving static content by default, so the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method using the following code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where the application looks for static files.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the following required app package files:

- A **full color icon** measuring 192 x 192 pixels.
- A **transparent outline icon** measuring 32 x 32 pixels.
- A **manifest.json** file that specifies the attributes of your app.

These files need to be zipped in an app package for use in uploading your tab to Teams.

#### .csproj

In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file you see the following code that creates and updates your zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
  </ItemGroup>
```

#### Models

**ChannelGroup.cs** presents a Message object and methods that will be called from the controllers during configuration.

#### Views

These are the different views in ASP.NET Core MVC:

* Home: ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** will be displayed as the home page for your application.

* Shared: The partial view markup **_Layout.cshtml** contains the application's overall page structure and shared visual elements. It will also reference the Teams Library.

#### Controllers

The controllers use the `ViewBag` property to transfer values dynamically to the views.

[!INCLUDE [dotnet-ngrok-intro](~/includes/tabs/dotnet-ngrok-intro.md)]

* Open a command prompt in the root of your project directory and run the following command:

    ```bash
    ngrok http https://localhost:443560 -host-header="localhost:44360"
    ```

* Ngrok will listen to requests from the internet and will route them to your application when it is running on port 44355. It should resemble `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/` where **y8rCgT2b** is replaced by your ngrok alpha-numeric HTTPS URL.

* Ensure that you keep the command prompt with ngrok running and make a note of the URL.

### Update your application

Within **Tab.cshtml** the application presents the user with two option buttons for displaying the tab with either a red or gray icon. Choosing the **Select Gray** or **Select Red** button, triggers `saveGray()` or `saveRed()`, respectively, sets `settings.setValidityState(true)`, and enables the **Save** button on the configuration page. This code lets Teams know that you have completed the configuration requirements and the installation can proceed. On save, the parameters of `settings.setSettings` are set. Finally, `saveEvent.notifySuccess()` is called to indicate that the content URL has been successfully resolved.

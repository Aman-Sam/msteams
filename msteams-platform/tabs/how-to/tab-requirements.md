# Prerequisites

Personal Tabs can be built in **Node.js**, **ASP.NET Core**, or **ASP.NET Core MVC**. 

## Tools to build personal tabs

Here's a list of tools you'll need for building your personal tab.

| &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. Use the latest v14 LTS release.|
| &nbsp; | [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |
| &nbsp; | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. |
| &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.com/download), **ASP.NET and web development**, or **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload | .NET. You can install the free community edition of Visual Studio 2019. |
| &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots and messaging extensions) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that include only tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
| &nbsp; | [Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/) | Web-based portal to configure, manage, and distribute your Teams app including to your organization or the Teams store. |

Teams tabs must adhere to the following prerequisites:

* Allow your tab pages to be discovered in an iFrame, using X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy HTTP response headers.
  * Set header: `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors teams.microsoft.com *.teams.microsoft.com *.skype.com`
  * To be compatible for Internet Explorer 11, set `X-Content-Security-Policy`.
  * Alternately, set header `X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://teams.microsoft.com/`. This header is deprecated but still accepted by most browsers.

* Login pages do not render in iFrames, as a safeguard against clickjacking. Your authentication logic needs to use a method other than redirect. For example, use token-based or cookie-based authentication.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Chrome 80, scheduled for release in early 2020, introduces new cookie values and imposes cookie policies by default. It is recommended that you set the intended use for your cookies rather than rely on default browser behavior. For more information, see [SameSite cookie attribute](../../resources/samesite-cookie-update.md).

* Browsers same-origin policy restriction prevents webpages from making requests to different domains than the served web page. So, you can redirect the configuration or content page to another domain or subdomain. Your cross-domain navigation logic needs to allow the Teams client to validate the origin against a static `validDomains` list in the app manifest when loading or communicating with the tab.

* Style your tabs based on the Teams client's theme, design, and intent. Tabs work best when they are built to address a specific need and focus on a small set of tasks or a subset of data that is relevant to the tab's channel location.

* Within your content page, add a reference to [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client) using script tags. After your page loads, make a call to `microsoftTeams.initialize()`, otherwise your page is not displayed.

* For authentication to work on mobile clients, you must upgrade to Teams JavaScript SDK 1.4.1 and above.

* If you choose to have your channel or group tab appear on Teams mobile client, the `setSettings()` configuration must have a value for the `websiteUrl` property.

* Microsoft Teams tab does not support the ability to load intranet websites that use self-signed certificates.

## Tools you can use to build tabs
* [Teams Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Studio Code](../../toolkit/visual-studio-code-overview.md)
* [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio](../../toolkit/visual-studio-overview.md)

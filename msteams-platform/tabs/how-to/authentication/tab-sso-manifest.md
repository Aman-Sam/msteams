# Update app manifest for SSO and preview app

Before you update the app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest), ensure that you've configured code to enable SSO in your tab app.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Configure code](tab-sso-code.md)

You've registered your tab app in Azure AD, and obtained an app ID. You've also configured your code to call `getAuthToken()` and handle the access token. Now, you must update the app manifest to enable SSO for your tab app. The app manifest describes how an app integrates into Teams.

## webApplicationInfo property

Configure the `webApplicationInfo` property in the app manifest file. This property enables SSO for your app to help app users access your tab app seamlessly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/sso-manifest.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the app manifest configuration.":::

`webApplicationInfo` has two elements, `id` and `resource`.

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id | Enter the app ID (GUID) that you created in Azure AD. |
| resource | Enter your app's subdomain URI and the application ID URI that you created in Azure AD when creating scope. You can copy it from the **Azure AD** > **Expose an API** section. |

> [!NOTE]
> Use the app manifest version 1.5 or later to implement the `webApplicationInfo` property.

The application ID URI that you registered in Azure AD is configured with the scope of the API you exposed. Configure your app's subdomain URI in `resource` to ensure that the authentication request using `getAuthToken()` is from the domain given in the app manifest.

For more information, see [webApplicationInfo](../../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#webapplicationinfo).

## To configure app manifest

1. Open the tab app project.
2. Open the app manifest folder.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - The app manifest folder should be at the root of your project. For more information, see [Create a Microsoft Teams app package](../../../concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md).
    > - For more information on learning how to create a manifest.json, see [the app manifest schema](../../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).

1. Open the `manifest.json` file
1. Add the following code snippet to the app manifest file to add the new property:

    ```json
    "webApplicationInfo":
    {
    "id": "{Azure AD AppId}",
    "resource": "api://subdomain.example.com/{Azure AD AppId}"
    }
    ```

    where,
    - `{Azure AD AppId}` is the app ID you created when you registered your app in Azure AD. It's the GUID.
    - `subdomain.example.com` is the application ID URI that you registered when creating scope in Azure AD.

4. Update the app ID from Azure AD in the **id** property.
5. Update the subdomain URL in the following properties:
   1. `contentUrl`
   2. `configurationUrl`
   3. `validDomains`
6. Save the app manifest file. For more information, see [app manifest](../../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).

> [!NOTE]
> During debug, you can use ngrok to test your app in Azure AD. In that case, you need to replace the subdomain in `api://subdomain.example.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` with the ngrok URL. You'll need to update the URL whenever your ngrok subdomain changes. For example, api://23c3-103-50-148-128.ngrok.io/bccfbe67-e08b-4ec1-a7fd-e0aaf41a097c.

## Sideload and Preview in Teams

You've configured the tab app to enable SSO in Azure AD, in app code, and in the app manifest file. You can now sideload your tab app in Teams, and preview it in Teams environment.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/sso-flow.png" alt-text="SSO app":::

To preview your tab app in Teams:

1. Create an app package.

   The app package is a zip file that contains the app manifest file and app icons.

1. Open Teams.

1. Select **Apps** > **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app**.

    The options to upload an app appear.

1. Select **Upload a custom app** to sideload the tab app to Teams.

1. Select your app package zip file, and then select **Add**.

    The tab app is sideloaded and the dialog appears to inform you of the additional permissions that may be required.

1. Select **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/teams-sso-consent.png" alt-text="Teams dialog box informing about additional permissions required":::

    The Azure AD consent dialog appears.

1. Select **Accept** to give consent for open-id scopes.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/aad-sso-consent.png" alt-text="Azure AD consent dialog":::

    Teams opens the tab app and you can use it.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/teams-sso-app.png" alt-text="Example of Teams tab app with SSO enabled":::

    Congratulations! You've enabled SSO for your tab app.

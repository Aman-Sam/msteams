# What are tabs in Microsoft Teams?

Tabs let you embed web-based content in Teams. They are simple iframes that point to domains declared in your app manifest and can be part of a team channel, group chat, or personal app. *See* [Teams JavaScript client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client).

There are two types of tabs in Teams: channel/group and personal tabs. A channel/group tab delivers content to channels and group chats and are a great way to create collaborative spaces around dedicated web-based content. Personal tabs, along with personally-scoped bots, are part of personal apps and are for interactions with a single user. They can be pinned to the left navigation bar for easy access.

## User scenarios

**Scenario:** Bring an existing web-based resource inside Teams. \
**Example:** You create a personal tab in your Teams app that presents an informational corporate website to users.

**Scenario:** Add support pages to a Teams bot or messaging extension. \
**Example:** You create personal tabs that provide about and help webpage content to users.

**Scenario:** Provide access to items that your users interact with regularly for cooperative dialogue and collaboration. \
**Example:** You create a channel/group tab with deep linking to individual items.

## How do tabs work?

A custom tab is declared in the app manifest of your app package. For each webpage you want included as a tab in your app you define a URL and a scope. Additionally, you need to add the [Teams JavaScript client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client) to your page, and call `microsoftTeams.initialize()` after your page loads. Doing so will tell Teams to display your page, give you access to Teams-specific information (for example if the Teams client is running the Dark Theme), and allow you to take action based on the results.

Whether you choose to expose your tab within the channel/group or personal scope, you'll need to present an IFramed HTML [content page](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/content-page.md) in your tab. For personal tabs, the content URL is set directly in your manifest by the `contentUrl` property in the `staticTabs` array. Your tab's content will be the same for all users.

For channel/group tabs, you also need to create an additional configuration page that allows your users to configure your content page URL, typically by using URL query string parameters to load the appropriate content for that context. This is because your channel/group tab can be added to multiple different teams or group chats. On each subsequent install, your users will be able to configure the tab allowing you to tailor the experience as needed. When users add a tab or configure a tab, a URL is being associated with the tab that is presented in the Teams UI. Configuring a tab is simply adding additional parameters to that URL. For example, when you add the Azure DevOps board tab the configuration page allows you to choose which board the tab will load. The configuration page URL is specified by the  `configurationUrl` property in the `configurableTabs` array in your app manifest.

You can have a maximum of one channel/group tab and up to 16 personal tabs per app.

## Lesser-known tab features

* If a tab is added to an app that also has a bot, the bot is also added to the team.
* Awareness of the current user's Azure Active Directory ID.
* Locale awareness for the user to indicate language (for example, `en-us`).
* SSO capability, if supported.
* Ability to use bots or app notifications to deep link to the tab or to a sub-entity within the service (for example, an individual work item).
* The ability to open a Task module from links within a tab.
* Reuse SharePoint web parts in the tab.

## Tabs on mobile

If you choose to have your channel/group tab appear on Teams mobile clients, the `setSettings()` configuration must have a value for the `websiteUrl` property (see below). Personal tabs are currently available in [developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md). Full support for tabs on mobile clients will be released soon. To prepare for the update, you should follow the [guidance for tabs on mobile](~/tabs/design/tabs-mobile.md) when creating your tabs.

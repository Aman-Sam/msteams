# Tabs link unfurling and Stage View

Stage View is a user interface (UI) component, that allows you to render content opened in full screen in Teams and pinned as a tab. Now you can access Stage View in different chat window. It allows users to maintain their context within their new window experience while continuing  group chat conversation. <br> Developers have to enable Tab link Unfurling for their app to get Stage View update for free. Users are still able to pin the app content as a tab. It's a new entry point to pinning app content but it will not change the existing functionality of tabs or pinning.

## Stage View

Stage View is a full screen UI component that you can invoke to surface your web content. The existing link unfurling service is updated so that it's used to turn URLs into a tab using an Adaptive Card and Chat services.

* When users invoke Stage View from Adaptive cards within chats, Stage View opens in a new window
* When a user sends a URL in a chat or channel, the URL is unfurled to an Adaptive Card. The user can select **View** in the card, and pin the content as a tab directly from Stage View

## Advantages of Stage View

* Provides enhanced experience to view content in Teams
* Allows users to do multi-task within Teams in a separate window

## Limitations of Stage View

* If a Stage View is already open, and the user selects on another stage link in the same chat, it will replace the existing Stage View window

* If a Stage View with chat is open and a meeting with the same chat gets started, Stage View window will get closed automatically. When the meeting ends, Stage View window will be restored

* If a Stage View link is opened from main window or chat window, it will replace with the Stage View window with side chat pane

## Stage View vs. Task module

|Stage View|Task module|
|:-----------|:-----------|
|Stage View is useful to display rich content to the users, such as a page, a dashboard, a file, and so on. It provides rich features that help to render your content in the new pop-up window.|[Task module](../task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/task-modules-tabs.md) is especially useful to display messages that require user attention, or collect information required to move to the next step.|
  
## Invoke Stage View

You can invoke Stage View in the following  ways:

* [Invoke Stage View from Adaptive Card](#invoke-stage-view-from-adaptive-card)
* [Invoke Stage View through deep link](#invoke-stage-view-through-deep-link)

## Invoke Stage View from Adaptive Card

When the user enters a URL on the Teams desktop client, the bot is invoked and returns an [Adaptive Card](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-actions.md) with the option to open the URL in a stage. Now Stage View opens in a new window with chat docked to the side. After a stage is launched and the **tabInfo** is provided, you can pin the stage as a tab.

An Adaptive Card opens a stage in the following images:

:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/open-stage-from-adaptive-card1.png" alt-text="Open a stage from Adaptive Card" border="true":::

:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/open-stage-from-adaptive-card2.png" alt-text="Open a stage" border="true":::

### Example

Following is the code to open a stage from an Adaptive Card:

```json
{
    type: "Action.Submit",
    name: "View",
    data: {
          msteams: {
            type: "invoke",
            value: {
                type: "tab/tabInfoAction",
                tabInfo: {
                    contentUrl: contentUrl,
                    websiteUrl: websiteUrl,
                    name: "Tasks",
                    entityId: "entityId"
                 }
                }
            }
        }
} 
```

The `invoke` request type must be `composeExtension/queryLink`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * `invoke` workflow is similar to the current `appLinking` workflow
> * To maintain consistency, it is recommended to name `Action.Submit` as `View`
> * `websiteUrl` is a required property to be passed in the `TabInfo` object

**To invoke Stage View**:

1. When the user selects **View**, the bot receives an `invoke` request. The request type is `composeExtension/queryLink`.
1. `invoke` response from bot contains an Adaptive Card with type `tab/tabInfoAction` in it.
1. The bot responds with a `200` code.

> [!NOTE]
> On Teams mobile clients, invoking Stage View for apps distributed through the [Teams store](/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-publish-overview.md) and not having a moblie-optimized experience opens the default web browser of the device. The browser opens the URL specified in the `websiteUrl` parameter of the `TabInfo` object.

## Invoke Stage View through deep link

To invoke the Stage View through deep link from your tab, you must wrap the deep link URL in the `microsoftTeams.executeDeeplink(url)` API. The deep link can also be passed through an `OpenURL` action in the card.

> [!NOTE]
> All deeplinks must be encoded before pasting the URL. We don't support unencoded URLs.
>
> * The `name` is optional in deep link. If not included, the app name replaces it
> * When you launch a Stage from a certain context, ensure that your app works in that context. For example, if your Stage View is launched from a personal app, you must ensure your app has a personal scope

### Syntax

Following is the keeplink syntax:

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/{appId}/0?context={"contentUrl":"contentUrl","websiteUrl":"websiteUrl","name":"Contoso"}

### Examples

When a user enters a URL, it's unfurled into an Adaptive card.Following are the deep link examples to invoke Stage View:

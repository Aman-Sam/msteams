# Open content in Stageview

Microsoft Teams provides multiple methods to open your app content in immersive canvas experiences. Stageview canvases allow the users to adopt mulitasking inside Teams, for example, you can have a specific chat alongside a new Teams window. You can also collaborate with others directly in a Teams multiwindow or work in large modal experience.

> [!NOTE]
> The article is based on Teams JavaScript client library (TeamsJS) version 2.0.x. If you're using an earlier version, see [TeamsJS](how-to/using-teams-client-library.md) for guidance between the latest and earlier versions.

## Types of Stageview

 Based on the UI and functionality, Stageview provides three ways to open your app content:

* [Collaborative Stageview](#collaborative-stageview)
* [Stageview Multi-window](#stageview-multi-window)
* [Stageview Modal](#stageview-modal)

### Collaborative Stageview

Collaborative Stageview enables multitasking scenarios for your app content in Teams. Users can open and view your app content inside a new Teams window while accompanied by a side panel conversation. This view enables meaningful content engagement and collaboration from within the same window.

**Best usage**: When content is opened from a conversation such as chat, channel, or channel tab.

### Stageview Multi-window

Stageview Multi-window is useful for scenarios that requires a user to multitask in Teams without the need for collaboration. This view opens the app content in a new Teams window without a side panel conversation allowing users to focus on their task.

**Best usage**: When content is opened from a nonconversational surface such as a personal app.

### Stageview Modal

Stageview Modal is a full-screen UI component used to render your app content inside the Teams main window. This view provides users with a focused experience to engage with the app content. Stageview Modal is useful for displaying rich content that doesn't require a user to multitask. Itâ€™s the default view when Collaborative Stageview and Stageview Multi-window aren't supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Teams web client supports Stageview Modal only.

## Invoke Stageview

You can invoke Stageview in Teams through one of the following methods and also configure the expected Stageview response. The following table provides the default and defined response behavior for each Stageview invoke type:

| Invoke method | Default response | Defined response |
| ---| ---| --- |
| [Adaptive Card](#invoke-collaborative-stageview-from-adaptive-card) | Opens in Collaborative Stageview | Opens in Stageview Modal, if Collaborative Stageview or Stageview Multi-window isn't supported. |
| [stageView API](#invoke-from-stageview-api) | Opens in Collaborative Stageview | Opens in the respective Stageview based on the `openMode` [defined](#openmode). |
| [Deep link](#invoke-from-deep-link)| Opens in Collaborative Stageview | Opens in the respective Stageview based on the `openMode` [defined](#openmode). |

> [!NOTE]
> When you invoke Stageview from a certain context, ensure that your app works in that context. For example, to launch Stageview from a personal app, ensure that the app supports personal scope only.

<br>
<details>
<summary id="openmode" ><b>openMode property</b></summary>

`openMode` is a property in [StageViewParams interface](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/stageview.stageviewparams). The `openMode` property can be defined in a [stageView API](#invoke-from-stageview-api) or a [deep link](#invoke-from-deep-link) to determine the type of Stageview response. The three `openMode` properties are:

* `popoutWithChat`
* `popout`
* `modal`

The fallback hierarchy for a Stageview response is `popoutWithChat` > `popout` > `modal`.

The following table provides the Stageview responses of the `openMode` property:

| Input | Response |
| ---| ---|
| `openMode` not defined | Opens by default in Collaborative Stageview with an associated side panel conversation. |
| `openMode` defined as `popoutWithChat` | Opens in Collaborative Stageview with an associated side panel conversation. |
| `openMode` defined as `popout`| Opens in Stageview Multi-window without a side panel conversation. |
| `openMode` defined as `modal` | Opens in Stageview Modal. |

> [!NOTE]
> In scenarios were pop-out experience isn't supported, for example, Teams web client, the content opens in a Stageview Modal even when the `openMode` property is defined.

</details>

### Invoke Collaborative Stageview from Adaptive Card

Collaborative Stageview from an Adaptive Card allows users to engage with your content while continuing the conversation flow. When a user enters a URL for an app content in a chat, the bot is invoked and returns an Adaptive Card with an option to open the URL. If the URL is opened from an Adaptive Card in Teams web client, it opens in a Stageview Modal.

The following steps help you to understand how Collaborative Stageview is invoked from an Adaptive Card:

1. When the user shares a URL in a Teams chat, the bot receives a `composeExtensions/queryLink` invoke request. The bot returns an Adaptive Card with the type `tab/tabInfoAction`.

1. After the user selects the action button on the Adaptive Card, Collaborative Stageview opens based on the content in the Adaptive Card.

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tab-images/collab-view.gif" alt-text="The graphical representation shows how Collaborative Stageview response from Adaptive Card.":::

The following code is an example to create an action button in an Adaptive Card:

```json
{
  "type": "Action.Submit",
  "title": "Open",
  "data": {
    "msteams": {
      "type": "invoke",
      "value": {
        "type": "tab/tabInfoAction",
        "tabInfo": {
          "contentUrl": "contentUrl",
          "websiteUrl": "websiteUrl",
          "name": "Sales Report",
          "entityId": "entityId"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Best practices for creating an Adaptive Card**

* The content URL must be within the list of `validDomains` in your app manifest.
* The invoke request type must be `composeExtensions/queryLink`.
* The `invoke` workflow must be similar to the `appLinking` workflow.
* The `Action.Submit` must be configured as `Open` to maintain consistency.

If your app isn't optimized to work in Teams mobile client, Stageview for apps distributed through the [Microsoft Teams Store](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-publish-overview.md) opens in a default web browser. The browser opens the URL specified in the `websiteUrl` parameter of the `TabInfo` object.

### Invoke from stageView API

The stageView API from TeamsJS allows you to open the Teams window in a Stageview experience based on the `openMode` defined. If the `openMode` property isn't defined, the default response is a Collaborative Stageview with an associated side panel conversation. The side panel conversation is the same thread from where the Collaborative Stageview was invoked such as chat or group chat.

> [!NOTE]
> The stageView API supports an optional `threadId` parameter that allows you to bring a specific conversation into the Collaborative Stageview side panel. Mapping `contentUrl` to `threadId` allows you to persist a conversation alongside content.

The following code provides the samples of each `openMode` property in stageView API:

# [popoutWithChat](#tab/withchat)

The `openMode` property defined as `popoutWithChat` in [StageViewParams](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/stageview.stageviewparams) to open in Collaborative Stageview.

  ```json
    {
      "appId": "2c19df50-1c3c-11ea-9327-cd28e4b6f7ba",
      "contentUrl": "https://teams-test-tab.azurewebsites.net",
      "title": "Test tab ordering",
      "websiteUrl": "https://teams-test-tab.azurewebsites.net",
      "openMode": "popoutWithChat"
    }
  ```

# [popout](#tab/popout)

The `openMode` property defined as `popout` in [StageViewParams](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/stageview.stageviewparams) to open in Stageview Multi-window.

  ```json
    {
      "appId": "2c19df50-1c3c-11ea-9327-cd28e4b6f7ba",
      "contentUrl": "https://teams-test-tab.azurewebsites.net",
      "title": "Test tab ordering",
      "websiteUrl": "https://teams-test-tab.azurewebsites.net",
      "openMode": "popout"
    }
  ```

# [modal](#tab/modal)

The `openMode` property defined as `modal` in [StageViewParams](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/stageview.stageviewparams) to open in Stageview Modal.

  ```json
    {
      "appId": "2c19df50-1c3c-11ea-9327-cd28e4b6f7ba",
      "contentUrl": "https://teams-test-tab.azurewebsites.net",
      "title": "Test tab ordering",
      "websiteUrl": "https://teams-test-tab.azurewebsites.net",
      "openMode": "modal"
    }
  ```

---

When `openMode` isn't defined in [StageViewParams](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/stageview.stageviewparams), the default response is Collaborative Stageview.

  ```json
    {
      "appId": "2c19df50-1c3c-11ea-9327-cd28e4b6f7ba",
      "contentUrl": "https://teams-test-tab.azurewebsites.net",
      "title": "Test tab ordering",
      "websiteUrl": "https://teams-test-tab.azurewebsites.net"
    }
  ```

### Invoke from deep link

To invoke Stageview through deep link from your tab or personal app, wrap the deep link URL in the [app.openLink(url) API](/javascript/api/%40microsoft/teams-js/app#@microsoft-teams-js-app-openlink) and define the `openMode` property for the chat content to open. When the openMode property isn't specified, Stageview response from a deep link defaults to Collaborative Stageview.

You must also specify a `threadId` to display a specific chat else the side panel conversation brings the group chat or channel thread from which the deep link is invoked.

> [!NOTE]
> All deep links must be encoded before pasting the URL. Unencoded URLs aren't supported.

#### Syntax

Deep link syntax for Collaborative Stageview:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/{appId}/0?context={"contentUrl":"contentUrl","websiteUrl":"websiteUrl","name":"Contoso","openMode":"popoutWithChat"}`

## FAQs

</br>

<details>

<summary>Which Stageview should I use?</summary>

Collaborative Stageview allows the users to open content along with a side panel conversation in a Teams window. We recommend this view for most of the collaboration scenarios.

</br>

</details>

<details>

<summary>What's the difference between Stageview Modal and dialogs?</summary>

Stageview Modal is useful to display rich content to the users, such as page, dashboard, or file. <br> Dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) are useful to display messages that need users' attention or collect information required to move to the next step.

</br>

</details>

<details>

<summary>When Stageview is invoked, the content opens in Collaborative Stageview but gets loaded in the main Teams window instead of a new window. How to open in a new window?</summary>

Ensure that your `contentUrl` domain is accurately reflected in the manifest `validDomains` property. For more information, see [app manifest schema](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).

</br>

</details>

<details>

<summary>The `contentUrl` matches `validDomains` but why any content isn't still displayed in a new Teams window?</summary>

Call `app.notifySuccess()` in all iframe-based contents to notify Teams that your app is loaded successfully. If applicable, Teams hides the loading indicator. If `notifySuccess` isn't called within 30 seconds, Teams assumes that the app is timed out, and displays an error screen with a retry option. For app updates, this step is applicable for tabs that are already configured. If you don't perform this step, an error screen is displayed for the existing users.

</br>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I include a deep link in my `contentUrl`?</summary>

No, deep links aren't supported in `contentUrl`.

</br>

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I keep a specific thread shown alongside my content?</summary>

Collaborative Stageview from a deep link or stageView API comes with the additional `threadId` parameter. You can explicitly define the chat thread to be displayed in the side panel for your specific `contentUrl`. For more information about retrieving a `threadId`, see [get conversation thread](/graph/api/group-get-thread).

# Tabs link unfurling and Stageview

Stageview is a user interface (UI) component that allows you to render content in a full screen within Teams or as a new window.

> [!NOTE]
> This article is based on  Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library version 2.0.x. If you are using an earlier version, see [TeamsJS](how-to/using-teams-client-library.md) for guidance on the differences between the latest TeamsJS and earlier versions.

<!--It allows users to maintain their context within their new window experience while continuing  group chat conversation. <br> Developers have to enable Tab link Unfurling for their app to get Stageview update for free. Users are still able to pin the app content as a tab. It's a new entry point to pinning app content but it will not change the existing functionality of tabs or pinning. 

[!INCLUDE [sdk-include](~/includes/sdk-include.md)]-->

## Stageview

Stageview is a full screen UI component that can be used to render your app content, providing users with a focused experience to engage with your app. Stageview can be invoked from either an Adaptive Card or a deep link, in both chats and channels.

* When users invoke Stageview from Adaptive Cards, Stageview opens in a new Teams window along with the originating chat or channel thread in the side panel. This new app canvas is called the [Collaborative Stageview](#collaborative-stage-view). The Collaborative Stageview allows users to multi-task and collaborate with each other.

* The Collaborative Stageview surfaces the originating chat or thread from where it was invoked and helps the users to engage with content and conversation side-by-side.

The following image is an example of the Collaborative Stageview:

### Stageview vs. Dialog

| Stageview | Dialog (referred as task module in TeamsJS v1.x)|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Stageview is useful to display rich content to the users, such as a page, a dashboard, or a file. It provides rich features that help to render your content in the new pop-up window and the full-screen canvas. <br><br> After your app content opens in Stageview, users can choose to pin the content as a tab. <br><br> For more collaborative capabilities, opening your content in Collaborative Stageview (through an Adaptive Card) allows users to engage with content and conversation side-by-side, while enabling multi-window scenarios.| [Dialog](../task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/task-modules-tabs.md) is especially useful to display messages that need users' attention, or collect information required to move to the next step.|

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft's cloud services, including web versions of Teams (*teams.microsoft.com*), Outlook (*outlook.com*), and Microsoft 365 (*microsoft365.com*) domains are migrating to the *cloud.microsoft* domain. Perform the following steps before June 2024 to ensure your app continues to render on the Teams web client:
>
> 1. Update TeamsJS SDK to v.2.19.0 or higher. For more information about the latest release of TeamsJS SDK, see [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js).
>
> 2. Update your [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) headers in your Teams app to allow your app to access the ***teams.cloud.microsoft*** domain. If your Teams app extends across Outlook and Microsoft 365, ensure you allow your app to access ***teams.cloud.microsoft***, ***outlook.cloud.microsoft***, and ***m365.cloud.microsoft*** domains.

### Invoke Stageview through deep link

To invoke the Stageview through deep link from your tab, you must wrap the deep link URL in the `app.openLink(url)` API. Stageview from a deep link always defaults to the modal experience (and not a Teams window). While the Stageview deep link can be passed through an `OpenURL` action in the card, the Stageview deep link is intended for the tab canvas. For Stageview from Adaptive Cards, it's recommended to follow the JSON [Adaptive Card example](#example).

The following image is an example of Stageview when it's invoked from a deep link:

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tab-images/open-stage-from-adaptive-card2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the open stage from card."lightbox="~/assets/images/tab-images/open-stage-from-adaptive-card2.png":::

#### Syntax

Following is the deep link syntax for Stageview:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/{appId}/0?context={"contentUrl":"contentUrl","websiteUrl":"websiteUrl","name":"Contoso"}`

#### Examples

Following are the deep link examples to invoke Stageview:

## Collaborative Stageview

> [!NOTE]
> Collaborative Stageview isn't supported in Teams web and mobile clients.

Collaborative Stageview is an enhancement to Stageview that allows users to engage with your app content in a new Teams window. When a user opens Collaborative Stageview from an Adaptive Card, the app content pops-out in a new Teams window instead of the default Stageview modal.

In the new Teams window, the Collaborative Stageview also opens a chat in the side panel. The chat brings the conversation from the group chat or channel thread where the users' Adaptive Card is originally shared. Users can continue to collaborate directly within the new window.

The following image is an example of Collaborative Stageview:

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tab-images/collaborative-stage-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Collaborative Stageview in Teams.":::

### Advantages of Collaborative Stageview

Collaborative Stageview helps unlock multi-tasking scenarios with your app content in Teams. Users can open and view your app content inside a new Teams window, while having meaningful conversation and collaboration from the same window. The ability to engage with content while also having a conversation on the content leads to higher user engagement for your app.

|Feature |Notes |Desktop |Web |Mobile|
|---      |:-----  |:--------   |:----  |:----- |
|Collaborative Stageview| Invoke from Adaptive Card action. |Chat or Channel: Opens Teams pop-out window with chat pane.| Opens Stageview modal. |Opens Stageview modal.|
|Stageview |Invoke from Deep link. Only recommended when calling from your tab app, and not an Adaptive Card. |Opens Stageview modal.| Opens Stageview modal.| Opens Stageview modal.|

### Invoke Collaborative Stageview from Adaptive Card

When the user enters an app content URL in a chat, the bot is invoked and returns an Adaptive Card with the option to open the URL. Depending on the context and the usersâ€™ client, the URL opens in the appropriate Stageview UI. When the Collaborative Stageview is invoked from an Adaptive Card in a chat or channel (and not from a deep link), a new window opens.

The following image is an example of a Collaborative Stageview from an Adaptive Card:

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tab-images/collaborative-stage-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Collaborative Stageview in Adaptive Card.":::

#### Example

The following is a JSON code example to create a Collaborative Stageview button in an Adaptive Card:

```json
{
  "type": "Action.Submit",
  "title": "Open",
  "data": {
    "msteams": {
      "type": "invoke",
      "value": {
        "type": "tab/tabInfoAction",
        "tabInfo": {
          "contentUrl": "contentUrl",
          "websiteUrl": "websiteUrl",
          "name": "Sales Report",
          "entityId": "entityId"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

The following steps show how to invoke Collaborative Stageview:

* When the user shares a URL in a Teams chat, the bot receives an `composeExtensions/queryLink` invoke request. The bot returns an Adaptive Card with the type `tab/tabInfoAction`.
* When the user selects the action button on the Adaptive Card, Collaborative Stageview opens based on the content in the Adaptive Card.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Passing a Stageview deep link into an Adaptive Card doesn't open the Collaborative Stageview. A Stageview deep link always opens the Stageview Modal.
> * Ensure that the URL of the content is within the list of `validDomains` in your app manifest.
> * The invoke request type must be a `composeExtensions/queryLink`.
> * `invoke` workflow is similar to the `appLinking` workflow.
> * To maintain consistency, it is recommended to name `Action.Submit` as `Open`.
> * `websiteUrl` is a required property to be passed in the `TabInfo` object.
> * If you don't have an optimized mobile experience for Teams mobile client, the Stageview for apps distributed through the [Microsoft Teams Store](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-publish-overview.md) opens in a default web browser. The browser opens the URL specified in the `websiteUrl` parameter of the `TabInfo` object.

#### Query parameters

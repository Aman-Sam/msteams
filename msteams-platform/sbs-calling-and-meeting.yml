    Calling and meeting bot provides basic functionalities like create a call, join a call, transfer or redirect a call, join a scheduled meeting, and invite the participants by integrating cloud communications API Graph API.
    
    Bots can interact with Teams calls and meetings using real time voice, video, and screen sharing. With Microsoft Graph APIs for calls and online meetings, Teams apps can now interact with users using voice and video to enhance the experience. These APIs allow you to add the following new features:

    * Interactive Voice Response (IVR).
    * Call control.
    * Access to real time audio and video streams, including desktop and app sharing.

    Create a bot and specify additional information and permissions to use these Graph APIs in a Teams app.
 
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create a bot with calling and meeting functionality. By the end of this tutorial, you can achieve the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     | &nbsp; | [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> Install one of the following two workloads:<br> • ASP.NET and web development <br> • .NET Core cross-platform development | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the workloads. |   
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK version 3.1 (not a guest account) ](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. If you haven't installed the .NET 3.1 (or later) SDK globally, the portable version can be installed. |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams and a Teams account](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, call and all in one place. |
     | &nbsp; | [Windows PowerShell](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-install) | Install by executing all the commands. |

    Register an application using app registration in the Microsoft Azure portal for your app to integrate with the Microsoft identity platform and call Microsoft Graph. Perform the following:

    1. Create a ngrok tunnel to the endpoints of your web server.
    1. Create Azure bot resource to register bot with Azure bot Service.
    1. Create client secret that enables SSO authentication of the bot.
    1. Create a policy for a demo tenant user for creating the online meetings using PowerShell.
    1. Add API permissions for downstream calls.
    1. Create bot channel registration in Azure account.
    1. Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    1. Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    **Create ngrok tunnel:**

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

    ```bash
    ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

    **Register an app in Azure:**

    1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your personal Microsoft account.
    1. Select the **Azure Active Directory**.
    1. In the left pane, Select **App registrations**.
    1. Select **New registration**.
    
        :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/calls-and-meetings/azure-active-directory.png" alt-text="Azure active directory.":::

    Microsoft Teams app that requires device permissions, such as location, camera, or microphone access, now require users to manually grant permission in the web browser. Previously, the browser handled how to grant access permissions, but now these permissions are handled in Teams.

    This step-by-step guide helps you to grant tab device permission at Teams. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

 
    *| &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, call and all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> Install one of the following two workloads:<br> • ASP.NET and web development <br> • .NET Core cross-platform development | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the workloads. |
     | &nbsp; | [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. Use the latest v16 LTS release.|
     | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
    
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

     Use ngrok or Command Prompt to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

     ```bash
     ngrok http --host-header=localhost 3000
     ``` 
       > [!TIP]
       > If you encounter **ERR_NGROK_4018**, follow the steps, as displayed in the Command Prompt to sign up and authenticate ngrok. Then run the `ngrok http --host-header=localhost 3000` command.

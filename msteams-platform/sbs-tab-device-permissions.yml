    Teams app that requires device permissions, such as location, camera, or microphone access, now allows the users to manually grant permission for the app using the web browser.
    Previously, the browser handled ways to grant the access, but now these permissions are handled in Teams.

    This step-by-step guide helps you to grant tab device permissions in Teams. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

    * Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunneling solution.
    * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
    * [Latest version of Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
    * [Microsoft 365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.

- title: Configure and run the Tab device permissions app on Teams
  durationInMinutes: 1

    The most comprehensive way to test your app is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is the only way to test the full functionality available to your app, across all scopes. 
    
    To configure and run the Teams app by uploading the manifest.zip file, perform the following:

    1. Configure and run your tab device permissions app.
    2. Begin your tunneling service to get an https endpoint.
    3. Run the tab device permissions by uploading the manifest.zip file in Teams.

    **To configure and run your tab device permissions app:**

    1. Open **command prompt** and clone a repository **git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git**. Ensure that you note the **Path** where the repository is cloned.
    2. In the **File Explorer**, go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > tab-device-permissions > nodejs** folder and copy the folder location.
    3. In the **command prompt**, enter **cd location (node js folder location)** and run this command.
    4. Run the following command in the **command prompt**:
    
       ```command-prompt
        npm install
        ```
    5. Run the application in the **command prompt** using following command:
    
       ```command-prompt
       npm start
       ```
    6. You can see the following output in the browser:

      :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tab-device-permission/sbs-react.PNG" alt-text="react" border="true":::
      

    **Begin your tunneling service to get an https endpoint:**

    1. Go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > tab-device-permissions > nodejs**.
    2. Open **ngrok** terminal and start a ngrok tunnel with the following command (you'll need the https endpoint to update the manifest file):

       ```ngrok
       ngrok http 3000 --host-header=localhost
       ```  
        
    **To run the tab device permissions by uploading the manifest.zip file in Teams:**

    1. In the **File Explorer**, go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > tab-device-permissions > nodejs > appPackage** folder.
    2. Open the **manifest.json** file in visual studio code.
    3. In the **manifest.json** file, find **<<BASE_URI_DOMAIN>>** and replace it with your https endpoint from ngrok excluding the "https://" part in all the places.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-device-permission/ngrok-tunnel.png alt-text="ngrok" border="true":::
     

    4. Zip the files in the **appPackage/folder** as manifest.zip.
    5. Open Teams on browser using tenant ID.
    6. To upload **manifest.zip**, select **Apps > Upload a custom app** and open **manifest.zip**.
    7. Select **Tab Device Permission** app.
    8. Select **Add** to add the tab device permission app.

    11. Open desktop Teams.
    12. To upload **manifest.zip**, select **Apps > Upload a custom app** and open **manifest.zip**.
    13. Select **Add** to add the tab device permission app and you will see the following output:

    To ensure that the tab device permission app enables user to give the permission, you must test the app after you successfully upload the app into Teams.

     # [Desktop](#tab/Desktop)

      To test the app on desktop, select **App Permission** icon and get the following prompts to accept permission request:

      # [Browser](#tab/Browser)

      To test the app in browser, select **Get Location** to see the following outputs:

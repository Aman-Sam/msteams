# Monetize your app

Microsoft Teams app Store provides features that empower you to monetize your apps by helping you retain and expand your customer base through interactive user engagement. Microsoft commercial marketplace hosts to publish offers through two main online store, Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource. The offers for your applications and solutions are published in the store and made available for customers.

## SaaS offer

SaaS applications published in Microsoft commercial marketplace are SaaS offers. The availability of the offer in the online store is based on the industry it's built for and the related configurations.

As a publisher, create your marketplace offers in Partner Center and have them in either of the online stores. In this module, you get to learn in detail on how to create a SaaS offer in Partner Center, configure the offer, link the offer to your app, and publish and manage the offer.

> [!NOTE]
> To publish your offer, you must have a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center.

## Choose a publishing option

Before you start creating an offer, you must first decide the listing or publishing option, that is, how you want to engage with your customers and the purchase experience you want to provide. When you are creating an offer, you're asked if you want to sell through Microsoft or not. Based on your response, the offer is published and a suitable call-to-action button appears on the offer listing page. The listing option also decides the technical requirements to create an offer. Let's learn in detail about in the following sections.

**Sell through Microsoft**

Offers sold through Microsoft are termed as transactable offers where Microsoft handles transactions for the licenses. With a transactable [Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offer](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/include-saas-offer.md), you can monetize your Teams app by selling subscription plans directly from your Teams store listing.

**Free trials**

You can offer a free trial version of your app to get more customers to try it. To entice customers to buy the full version, you can limit the features in the trial version (for example, only including limited number of responses for a week) or specify a period for the trial.

Some of the options that you can add to your SaaS offer

### In-app purchases

Use in-app purchases to let customers upgrade from a free to a paid version of your app. Whether you charge a price for your app or offer it for free, you can use in-app purchases in your app to provide an ongoing revenue stream.

[Use in-app purchases](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/in-app-purchase-flow.md)

### Test drive

With a transactable Software as a Service (SaaS) offer, you can allow customers to test the end-to-end purchase experience for your monetized apps for a fixed time. Test Drive and Free Trail are different, and you can offer one or both to the customers.

### Set up Microsoft license management

You can allow Microsoft to manage app licenses on your behalf or manage licenses yourself. If you select to use Microsoft license management to manage a SaaS license purchased in Teams, you can easily assign, unassign, use, and track SaaS licenses from the Teams store.

Now that we know about a SaaS offer and the listing methods, let's get started to create, configure, manage, test, and publish the SaaS offer. Let's also learn to configure the SaaS offer to your app and publish the app with the offer.

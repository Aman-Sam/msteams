# Monetize your Teams app

Microsoft Teams Store serves as a platform to monetize your app where you can create offers for your app and reach customers with the best and optimal solutions. It helps with better user engagement and widen your customer base. This guide is intended for developers looking to generate revenue from their apps.

Microsoft commercial marketplace facilitates publishing offers through Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource. The published offers are also available for purchase through Microsoft Teams Store.

Monetizing your app is a crucial step in the app development process. There are four ways by which you can drive app monetization:

      * **Subscription**: You can provide transactable offers that can be purchased. You can also provide a free app or allow your customers to bring their own licenses.

      * **Free trial**: You can provide free access to your app for a limited time or with limited functionality. This encourages users to purchase the full version after the trial period.

      * **Test drive**: You can provide access to preconfigured environment for a fixed period.

      * **Contact me**: You can allow users to contact you for specific offers, unique requirements, and any enquires.

 In this module, let's get to know about monetizing your apps in the Teams Store through SaaS offers.

## SaaS offer

SaaS applications published in Microsoft commercial marketplace for purchase are SaaS offers. As a publisher, you can create your marketplace offers in Partner Center and publish in the Teams Store or AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> To create and publish your offer, you must have a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center.

Here are some features you can integrate with the SaaS offer to enable better user experience and expand the customer base.

* **Publishing option**: The publishing option decides how your offer appears in the Teams Store. You can select a suitable option based on your requirements. Learn in detail about publishing options when [planning for a SaaS offer](include-saas-offer.md).</br>

* **In-app purchases**: The in-app purchase option allows the customers to upgrade from a free to a paid version of your app from within the app. Whether you charge a price for your app or offer it for free, you can use in-app purchases in your app to provide an ongoing revenue stream. </br>

* **Test drive**: With a transactable SaaS offer, you can allow customers to test the end-to-end purchase experience of your monetized apps for a fixed time. Test drive and free trials are different, and you can offer one or both features to the customers.</br>

* **Set up Microsoft license management**: You can allow Microsoft to manage app licenses on your behalf that helps to track and manage licenses from the Teams Store. For more information, see [Set up Microsoft license management](create-saas-offer.md#set-up-microsoft-license-management).

Now that we know about the monetizing options and a SaaS offer, let's get to learn about the entire process from planning to publishing the SaaS offer for your app.

 Let's get to know about monetizing your software as a service (SaaS) applications in the Teams store through SaaS offers.

## What's a SaaS offer?

SaaS applications published in Microsoft commercial marketplace for purchase are SaaS offers. The offers are available in one of the online stores based on the industry it's built for and the related configurations in the offer. As a publisher, you can create your marketplace offers in Partner Center and publish in the online store.

> [!NOTE]
> To create and publish your offer, you must have a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center.

In this module, get to learn about the entire process from planning the SaaS offer for your app to publishing your app with the SaaS offer. Here are some features you can opt to integrate with your SaaS offer to enable better user experience and expand the customer base.

* **Publishing option**: Selecting a publishing option is mandatory, however you can select a suitable option based on your requirements. You can either choose to sell through Microsoft or manage the transactions on your own. Let's learn in detail about it when [planning for SaaS offer](include-saas-offer.md).
* **In-app purchases**: The in-app purchase option allows the customers to upgrade from a free to a paid version of your app from within the app. Whether you charge a price for your app or offer it for free, you can use in-app purchases in your app to provide an ongoing revenue stream.
* **Test drive**: With a transactable SaaS offer, you can allow customers to test the end-to-end purchase experience of your monetized apps for a fixed time. Test drive and free trials are different, and you can offer one or both features to the customers.
* **Set up Microsoft license management**: You can allow Microsoft to manage app licenses on your behalf or manage licenses yourself. If you select to use Microsoft license management to manage a SaaS license purchased in Teams, you can assign, unassign, use, and track SaaS licenses from the Teams store. For more information, check [Set up Microsoft license management](create-saas-offer.md#set-up-microsoft-license-management).

Now that we know about monetizing options and SaaS offer, let's get started to create, configure, manage, test, and publish the SaaS offer. Also, learn to configure the SaaS offer to your app and publish the app with the offer in the marketplace.

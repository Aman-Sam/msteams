Planning your SaaS offer helps you to understand the suitable features for the offer. Here are the features you can plan ahead before creating an offer.

## Plan the publishing option

The initial step to create any SaaS offer is to decide the listing or publishing option, that is how the offer must be available in the marketplace. The option you select when creating the offer is available as a call-to-action button on the offer purchase landing page.

There are four listing options through which you can publish your SaaS offer:

* Sell through Microsoft
* Free trials
* Get it now (Free)
* Contact me

    :::column span="2":::

**Sell through Microsoft**

You can opt to sell your SaaS apps through Microsoft where Microsoft hosts all your transactions for the licenses purchased. Offers sold through Microsoft are transactable [SaaS offer](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/include-saas-offer.md) where you can sell subscription plans directly from your Teams Store.

    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

If you don't opt to sell through Microsoft, you can manage your transactions independently through any one of the following listing options.

     :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/saas-offer/pricing-free-trial.png" alt-text="Diagram represents the free trials.":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="2":::

**Free trials**

You can offer a free trial version of your app to get more customers to try it. To entice customers to buy the full version, you can limit the features in the trial version (for example, include only limited number of responses for a week) or specify a period for the trial.

    :::column span="2":::

**Get it now (Free)**

You can allow the user to subscribe and use your application at no cost. The options in free versions can be limited and the user can upgrade with subscriptions.

    :::column span="2":::

**Contact me**

Customers can share their details and ask that you contact them about the offer through the leads from Microsoft.

The type of listing option decides the technical configurations and requirements to create the specific offer in Microsoft Partner Center. You must fulfill the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) before you start creating the plan.

You can further allow Microsoft to manage licenses on your behalf. If you choose Microsoft to manage licenses, you must [integrate the offer with Microsoft Graph APIs](prerequisites.md#integrate-with-graph-usagerights-api) to verify customer eligibility.

## Plan for the offer details

You need to plan on the basic yet key features that decide the information available on the offer's landing page and the marketplace where the offer is published. The offer details help the users to find your offer easily in the marketplace and enhances usability.

* **Offer categories and industries**: Plan on the primary and secondary categories of the offer. It decides the store where the offer is published and to identify your app in the marketplace.
* **Offer details**: Plan for the logo, keywords, and description that helps to improve the discovery and value of your offer in the marketplace.
* **Preview audience**: Decide the audience and collate their email address to allow them to use and verify the preview offer before publishing live. The email address must be either of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Microsoft.
* **Legal terms and conditions**: Provide relevant information for the users to be aware of the terms of use of your app.
* **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: Provide the details to receive customer leads and reach you for queries.

## Prepare for offer's plan

SaaS offers published through Microsoft must have at least one plan added to the offer. Determining the plan features contributes to provide appropriate purchase options for the target users.

### Plan the subscription model

The subscription model or plan visibility decides if the plans can be public or private. Public plans are available for all customers while private plans are customized and visible only for targeted customers. For more information, see the [private plans in Microsoft commercial marketplace](/partner-center/marketplace/private-plans?branch=main).

Offers with private plans are published in Azure portal. Private plan can be converted to public plan later but can't be configured as private plan again.

### Plan the pricing options

When creating a plan, you can decide between two [pricing models](/partner-center/marketplace/plan-saas-offer?branch=main) available for SaaS offers.

* **Flat rate**: To charge based on the software usage across the organization. For the flat rate pricing model, you can opt to use [metered billing](/partner-center/marketplace/plans-pricing?branch=main) for consumption-based pricing.
* **Per user**: To charge for each unique user.

The [billing terms](/partner-center/marketplace/plan-saas-offer?branch=main) indicate the subscription period and can be set as monthly or annual.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * An offer can have only one pricing model. For example, a SaaS offer can't have one plan that is a flat rate and another plan that is per user.
> * The pricing model and billing terms canâ€™t be changed once the offer is published.

## Plan for additional features

In addition to the basic and essential planning, you can provide additional features to promote user engagement. These features help the users get a hands-on experience of using your app before they decide to purchase offers.

### Free trails

You can provide free trials for your SaaS offer. When you sell through Microsoft, you can offer a free trial of one month, and Microsoft converts it to a paid subscription by the end of the trial period.

### Test drive

You can opt to add test drive for your SaaS app that provides access to the preconfigured environment of your app for fixed hours. For more information, see [Test drive for SaaS offer](/partner-center/marketplace/create-new-saas-offer).

### Mobile version

To avoid violating third-party app store policies, your app can't include links that allow users to purchase subscription plans on mobile. However, you can still indicate if your app has features that require a subscription plan. For more information, see the [related commercial marketplace certification policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies).

## Offer plan

SaaS offers published through Teams Store or AppSource must have at least one plan added. The plan features facilitate appropriate purchase options for the target users.

### Plan the subscription model

The subscription model or plan visibility decides if the plans can be public or private. Public plans are available for all customers while private plans are customized and visible only for targeted customers. For more information, see the [private plans in Microsoft commercial marketplace](/partner-center/marketplace/private-plans?branch=main).

Offers with private plans are published in Azure portal. A private plan can be converted to public plan but can't be configured as private plan again.

### Plan the pricing options

When creating a plan, you can select from two [pricing models](/partner-center/marketplace/plan-saas-offer?branch=main) available for SaaS offers.

* **Flat rate**: To charge based on the software usage across the organization. For the flat rate pricing model, you can opt to use [metered billing](/partner-center/marketplace/plans-pricing?branch=main) for consumption-based pricing.
* **Per user**: To charge for each unique user.

The [billing terms](/partner-center/marketplace/plan-saas-offer?branch=main) define the subscription period that can be set as monthly or annual.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * An offer can have only one pricing model. For example, a SaaS offer can't have one plan that's a flat rate and another plan that's per user.
> * The pricing model and billing terms canâ€™t be altered once the offer is published.

## Additional features

In addition to the basic and essential planning, you can provide more features to promote user engagement. These features provide users with a firsthand experience of your app before they decide to purchase offers.

### Free trails

When selling through Microsoft, you can provide a one-month free trial. Microsoft automatically transitions the user to a paid subscription after the trial period.

### Test drive

You can add test drive for your SaaS app that provides access to the preconfigured environment of your app for fixed hours. For more information, see [Test drive for SaaS offer](/partner-center/marketplace/create-new-saas-offer).

### Mobile version

To adhere to third-party app store policies, your app mustn't include links that allow users to purchase subscription plans on mobile. However, you can still indicate if your app has features that require a subscription plan. For more information, see the [related commercial marketplace certification policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies).

# Purchase and manage app subscriptions and licenses

Add functionality to your Teams experience by subscribing and managing licenses for apps made just for Teams. When you add an app to Teams, check if additional features are available through subscription. You can purchase subscriptions and manage licenses for yourself, your team, or your organization directly from the Teams store.

## Subscription experience

The following example shows how users can purchase subscription plans for a fictional Teams app called *Recloud*:

1. In the Teams store, find and select the *Recloud* app.

1. In the app details dialog, select **Buy a subscription**.

1. Select your country to see subscription plans for your location.

1. In the **Choose a subscription plan** dialog, choose the plan you want and select **Checkout**. (Note: Private plans are visible only to users in orgs you're providing the offer to. These plans are indicated with a **Special offer** :::image type="icon" source="~/assets/icons/special-icon.png"::: icon.)

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/saas-offer/choosingsubscriptionplan.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows selecting the appropriate subscription plan.":::

1. In the **Checkout** dialog, provide any required information and select **Place order**.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/saas-offer/placesubscriptionorder.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows placing the subscription order.":::

1. During checkout, select how many subscription licenses you want, enter a **Sold-to address**, and provide a payment method. For **Sold-to address**, enter the address of the legal entity responsible for payment and identified on the invoice (business or residence). The **Sold-to address** determines the estimated tax rate for your purchase.

1. Select **Place order**.

1. When prompted, select **Set up now** to activate your subscription.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/saas-offer/saas-offer-set-up.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to set up your subscription.":::

    You're redirected to the *Recloud* website to activate your subscription.

1. Manage your subscription plan through the *Recloud* website (also known as a [landing page](include-saas-offer.md#build-a-landing-page-for-subscription-management)).

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/saas-offer/subscriptionlicenses.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows User and Licenses screen to assign license.":::

When a new user launches the app for the first time, they're requested to provide consent to the app. Following is an example of the consent screen shown when calling for user profile data with minimum User.Read permission.

Consent dialog is part of the flow to get the users license information and may vary based on ISVâ€™s integration approach.

# End-user purchase experience

Add functionality to your Teams experience by subscribing to apps made just for Teams and managing licenses. When you add an app to Teams, check if additional features are available through subscription. You can purchase subscriptions and manage licenses for yourself, your team, or your organization directly from Apps

When a new user launches the app for the first time, they're requested to provide consent to the app. Following is an example of the consent screen shown when calling for user profile data with minimum User.Read permission.

Consent dialog is part of the flow to get the users license information and may vary based on ISVâ€™s integration approach.

# Purchase and manage app subscriptions and licenses

When a new user launches the app for the first time, they're requested to provide consent to the app. Following is an example of the consent screen shown when calling for user profile data with minimum User.Read permission.

Consent dialog is part of the flow to get the user's license information and may vary based on ISVâ€™s integration approach.

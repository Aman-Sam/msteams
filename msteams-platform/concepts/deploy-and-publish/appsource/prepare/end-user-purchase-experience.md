# Purchase and manage app subscriptions and licenses

The information in this article helps you understand the purchase experience from the customer end. You can add additional features and functionality to your Teams app through subscriptions. Users can purchase subscriptions and manage licenses for themselves, their team, or their organization directly from the Teams store.

## Subscription experience

The following example shows how users can purchase subscription plans for a fictional Teams app called *Recloud*:

1. In the Teams store, find and select the *Recloud* app.

1. In the app details dialog, select **Buy a subscription**.

1. Select your country or region to see subscription plans for your location.

1. In the **Choose a subscription plan** dialog, choose the plan you want and select **Checkout**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Private plans are visible only to users of the organizations to whom the plans are made available. These plans are indicated with a **Special offer**:::image type="icon" source="~/assets/icons/special-icon.png"::: icon.

1. Manage your subscription plan through the *Recloud* website (also known as a [landing page](prerequisites.md#create-a-landing-page)).

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/saas-offer/subscriptionlicenses.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows User and Licenses screen to assign license.":::

When a new user launches the app for the first time, they're requested to provide consent to the app. Following is an example of the consent screen shown when calling for user profile data with minimum User.Read permission.

Consent dialog is part of the flow to get the users' license information and may vary based on ISVâ€™s integration approach.

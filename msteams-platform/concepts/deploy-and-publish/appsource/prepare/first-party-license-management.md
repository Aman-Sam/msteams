# First party license management enabled in Teams for third-party SaaS offers

With 1st party license management of 3P SaaS offers in the Teams surface area, our goal is to enable customers to easily assign, use, and track SaaS licenses purchased in Teams Storefront. This document focusses on the critical task of license management – the ability to authorize specific users to use a particular ISV application for the paid duration, where the license management happens post purchase of the said app (the associated SaaS offer) via Teams surface areas or via AppSource. Without licenses being assigned to given users, the app is unusable.

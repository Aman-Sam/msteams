# Distribute your Microsoft Teams app

Once you've created your app you have three options for distributing it to your users:

1. [Upload your app directly for yourself or a team](#upload-your-app-directly-for-yourself-or-a-team)
2. [Publish to you organization app catalog](#publish-to-your-organization-app-catalog)
3. [Publish your app through AppSource](#publish-to-appsource)

## Upload your app directly for yourself or a team

This is the easiest way to test and use your app. You can [Directly upload (or sideload) it for yourself or for your team](./apps-upload.md) and start using it. You don't need to get it approved from anyone. However, if you want to share the app with others, you have to send them your app package and ask them to sideload it themselves. 

If you want distribute your app more broadly,Teams provides an in-app gallery for users to find or discover high-quality Teams apps. To have your solution available in the gallery, you must either [Publish to you organization app catalog](#publish-to-your-organization-app-catalog) or [Publish to AppSource](./appsource/publish.md).

## Publish to your organization app catalog

Your organization's app catalog contains apps unique to your organization and is completely under your organization's control. You can find more information in the article [Publish apps to your organization's app catalog](/microsoftteams/tenant-apps-catalog-teams). This feature can only be managed by Teams users with Microsoft Office 365 tenant admin privileges.

## Publish to AppSource

AppSource (formerly known as Office Store) provides a convenient location for you to distribute your Microsoft Teams app, as well as other Office 365 extensibility types such as Office add-ins and SharePoint add-ins. To include your solution in AppSource, you [submit it to the Partner Center](/office/dev/store/use-partner-center-to-submit-to-appsource).
Go through our [AppSource submission process](./appsource/publish.md) to publish your app.

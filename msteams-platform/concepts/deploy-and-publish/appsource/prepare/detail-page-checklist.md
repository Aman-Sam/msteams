# Build a great app detail page 

Your detail page is users' first impressions of your app. Every element of your detail page can be used to convey your app's vision and drives downloads. Think through how you want to showcase your app in the limited space. Here are some tips and tricks to help you engage your users before they even install your app.

> [!NOTE] 
> Make sure your app descriptions also follow our [AppSource guidance for creating an effective store listing](/office/dev/store/create-effective-office-store-listings)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you copy over the description you write in AppScource onto the manifest. Teams will only use the description you provided in the manifest.

## App name

**Don'ts:**

## Short description
Short description is a summary of your app in a concise phrase.
You want it to be original, engaging, and directed at your target audience. Describe your solution and its value to your target customer, in one sentence.

**Do's:**
* Put the most important information first.
* Include keywords that customers might search for.

**Don’ts:**
* Repeat the title.
* Use jargon or specialized terminology; don't assume that users know what they're looking for.

## Long description
Provide an engaging description that highlights the main features, the problems it solves, and the target audience for your solution. Attract your audience with the first sentence of your description by communicating your app’s unique features. It must be under 4000 characters Most users read between 300 and 500 words.

**Do's:** 
* Use Teams simple mark up to spice up your descriptions
* List features to aid readers scanning your description.
* Use active voice and speak to users directly
* Use bullet point to list out your features
* Include a help or support link so your users know how to reach you if they have questions. 
**Don’ts:**
* Put too many keywords in your description -- it's distracting and won't help your app's discoverability.

### Screenshots 
The screenshots uploaded on the Seller Dashboard are displayed in both [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=office%3Bteams&page=1) and your app listing in the Teams client to provide a visual preview of your app along with your app description.
You can provide 1 to 5 screenshots. They can be .png, .jpg, or .gif files, and should be 1366x768 pixels, with a max size of 1024 KB.
**Do's:**
* Focus on highlighting all of your app's capabilitie.
* Not show any chrome/UI from outside of your app; do not capture any Teams or browser UI in your screenshots.
* Content should be representative of the app; do not include mock-ups that do not accurately reflect your apps actual UI such as showing your website instead of your Teams tab
* Text should be well-populated without being excessive
* You can surround your screenshots with a background color and add marketing content similar to the [Freshdesk](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104381505?src=office&tab=Overview) example. In that case the dimensions are not of the screenshot, they are of the overall image.

**Don'ts:** 
* Show specific devices, like phones or laptops

### Videos:

If an image is worth a thousand words then a video is worth a thousand images.
Videos are the most effective way to communicate the benefits of using your app. It will be placed in front of all your screenshots in the app detail page. Make sure you talk about how your app works, what can they do with it, why use your app and who is it for. Remember to keep it short and sweet: somewhere between 30-90 seconds.

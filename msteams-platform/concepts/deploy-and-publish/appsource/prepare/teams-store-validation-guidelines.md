# Microsoft Teams store validation guidelines

Following these guidelines increases the chances of your app to pass the Microsoft Teams store submission process. The Teams-specific guidelines complement the Microsoft [commercial marketplace certification policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1140-teams) and are updated frequently to reflect new capabilities, user feedback, and business rule changes.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Some guidelines may not be applicable to your app. For example, if your app doesn't include a bot, you can ignore bot-related guidelines.
> * We've cross-referenced these guidelines to the Microsoft commercial certification policies and added Do’s and Don’ts with examples from pass or fail scenarios encountered in our validation process.
> * Certain guidelines are marked as *Mandatory Fix*. If your app submission doesn't meet these mandatory guidelines, you'll receive a failure report from us with steps to mitigate. Your app submission will pass Microsoft Teams store Validation only after you have fixed the issues.
> * Other guidelines are marked as *Suggested Fix*. For an ideal user experience, we suggest that you fix the issues, however, your app submission will not be blocked from publishing on the Teams store, if you choose not to fix the issues.

## Value proposition

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.1](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#11401-value-proposition-and-offer-requirements) and provides additional guidance to developers of Microsoft Teams apps on their offer’s value proposition.

### App name

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with Microsoft [commercial certification policy number 1140.1.1](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114011-app-name) and provides additional guidance to developers on naming their apps.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

An app's name plays a critical role in how users discover it in the store. Use the following guidelines to name an app:

* The name must include terms relevant to your users.
* Prefix or suffix common nouns with the developer's name. For example, **Contoso Tasks** instead of **Tasks**.
* Must not use **Teams** or other Microsoft product names such as Excel, PowerPoint, Word, OneDrive, SharePoint, OneNote, Azure, Surface, and Xbox that could falsely indicate co-branding or co-selling. For more information about referencing Microsoft software products and services, see [Microsoft Trademark and Brand Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/general).
* Must not copy the name of an app listed in the store or other offer in the commercial marketplace.
* Must not contain profane or derogatory terms. The name also must not include racially or culturally insensitive language.
* Must be unique. If your app (Contoso) is listed in the Microsoft Teams store and Microsoft AppSource and you want to list another app specific to a geography such as Contoso Mexico, your submission must meet the following criteria:
  * Call out the app's region-specific functionality in the title, metadata, first response app experience, and help sections. For example, title must be Contoso Mexico. App title must clearly differentiate an existing app from the same developer to avoid end-user confusion.
  * When uploading the app package in Partner Center, select the right **Markets** where the app will be available in the **Availability** section.

* App name must not lead with a core Teams feature such as Chat, Contacts, Calendar, Calls, Files, Activity, Teams, Apps, and Help. The app name can shorten to either Chat, Contacts, Calendar, Calls, Files, Activity, Teams, Apps, and Help on install in the left nav.

* If your app is part of an official partnership with Microsoft, the name of your app must come first. For example, **Contoso Connector for Microsoft Teams**.

* The app name must not have any reference to Microsoft or Microsoft products. Don’t use **Teams**, **Microsoft**, or **App** in the app name unless your app is in official partnership with Microsoft. In such an instance, the app name must come first before any reference to Microsoft. For example, **Contoso connector for Microsoft Teams**.

* Don’t use parenthesis in naming to include Microsoft products.

* Developer name must be the same in the manifest and AppSource.

* App manifests submitted must be production manifests. Accordingly, app name must not indicate that the app is a pre-production app. For example, app name must not contain words such as Beta, Dev, Preview, and UAT.

 > [!TIP]
 > Your app’s branding on the Microsoft Teams store and AppSource including your app name, developer name, app icon, AppSource screenshots, video, short description and website either separately or taken together must not impersonate an official Microsoft offering unless your app is an official Microsoft 1P offering.

### Suitable for workplace consumption

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with Microsoft commercial certification policy number [1140.1.2](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114012-workplace-appropriateness), [100.8](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1008-significant-value), and [100.10](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#10010-inappropriate-content) and provides additional guidance to developers on building workplace appropriate apps.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

App content must be suitable for general workplace consumption and follow all restrictions listed in the commercial marketplace certification policies. Content related to religion, politics, gambling, and prolonged entertainment is prohibited.

Your app must enable group collaboration, improve an individual's productivity, or both. Apps intended for team bonding and socializing must be collaborative and designed for multiple participants. The apps must not require a substantial time investment of over 60 mins per session or affect productivity.

</details>

### Similar platforms and services

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.1.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114013-other-platforms-and-services).

Apps must focus on the Teams experience and not include the names, icons, or imagery of other similar chat-based collaboration platforms or services within the app content or in the app’s metadata unless the app provides specific interoperability.

### Feature names

App feature names in buttons and other UI text must not use terminology reserved for Teams and other Microsoft products. For example, **Start meeting**, **Make call**, or **Start chat** are feature names in use by Microsoft in Microsoft Teams. If necessary, include your app name to make the distinction clear, such as **Start Contoso meeting**.

### Authentication

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.1.4](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114014-access-to-services) and provides guidance to developers on authenticating their apps with external services.

For more information on how to implement app authentication, see [authentication in Teams](~/concepts/authentication/authentication.md).
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

#### Authenticating with external services

If your app authenticates users with an external service, follow these guidelines:

* **Sign in, sign out, and sign up experiences**:
  * Apps that depend on external accounts or services must provide clear and simple sign in, sign out, and sign up experience.
  * When users sign out, they must sign out only from the app and remain signed in to Teams.
  * Apps that depend on external accounts or services must provide a way forward for new users to sign up or contact the app publisher to learn more about the services and get access to the services.
  Way forward must be available in the app’s manifest, AppSource long description, and app first run experience (bot welcome message, tab setup or config page).
  * Apps that require tenant admin to complete one time setup must call out dependency on tenant admin to configure the app (before any other tenant user can install and use the app).
  Dependency must be called out in the app’s manifest, AppSource long description, all first run experience touchpoints (bot welcome message, tab setup or config page), help text as considered necessary as part of bot response, compose extension, or static tab content.
  
* **Content sharing experiences**: Apps that require authentication with an external service to share content in Teams channels must clearly state in the help documentation (or similar resources) on how to disconnect or unshare content if that feature is supported on the external service. This doesn't mean the ability to unshare content must be present in your Teams app.

</details>

## Security

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#11403-security).

### Financial information

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.3.1](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114031-financial-transactions) and provides guidance on transmission of financial information within the Teams interface and notifies developers of restricted payment scenarios on the mobile (Android and iOS) version of their Teams app.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Apps must not ask users to make payments within the Teams interface and transmit financial information to users through a bot interface.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-financial-information-1.png" alt-text="validation-financial-info":::

You may provide link to secure external payment services only if you disclose it in your terms of use, privacy policy, profile page, or website before the user agrees to use the app.

Don't facilitate payments through an app for goods or services prohibited by [General policy number 100.10 Inappropriate content](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#10010-inappropriate-content).

Apps running on the iOS or Android version of Teams must adhere to the following guidelines:

* Apps must not include in-app purchases, trial offers, or UI that aims to upsell users to paid versions or online stores to purchase other content, apps, or add-ins.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-financial-information-in-app-purchase.png" alt-text="validation-financial-info-in-app-purchase":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-financial-information-online-stores.png" alt-text="validation-online-store":::

* If your app requires an account, users can sign up for an account at no charge. The use of the term **free** or **free account** is prohibited.
* You can determine whether an account is active indefinitely or for a limited time. When the account expires the app must not show UI, text, or links indicating the need to pay.
* Your app's privacy policy and terms of use must be free of any commerce-related UI or links.

</details>

### Bots

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.3.2](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114032-bots-and-messaging-extension).
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

For apps that use the Microsoft Azure Bot Service (such as bots and message extensions), you must follow all requirements defined in the Microsoft [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=46).

Bots must always ask permission to upload a file and display a confirmation message.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-confirmation-message.png" alt-text="validation-bot-confirmation":::

</details>

### External domains

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.3.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114033-external-domains) and provides developer guidance on usage of restricted domains in the `validDomains` manifest property.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Don't include domains outside of your organization's control (including wildcards) and tunneling services in your app's domain configurations. The following exceptions include:

* If your app uses the Azure Bot Service's OAuthCard, you must include `token.botframework.com` as a valid domain or the **Sign in** button won't work.
* If your app relies on SharePoint, you can include the associated root SharePoint site as a valid domain using the `{teamSiteDomain}` context property.
* Don't use top level domains such as **.com**, **.in**, and **.org** as a valid domain. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Don't use **.onmicrosoft.com or** as a valid domain where **onmicrosoft** isn't under your control. However, you can use **yoursite.com** as a valid domain where **yoursite** is under your control even though the domain includes a wildcard. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app is a PowerApp built on the Microsoft Power Platform, you must include *apps.powerapps.com* as a valid domain to enable your app to be accessible and functional within Teams.

</details>

### Sensitive content

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Your app must not post sensitive data, such as credit card, financial payment details, health, contact tracing, or other personally identifiable information (PII) to an audience not intended to view the content.

App must warn users before downloading any files or executables (.exe) into the user's machine or environment.

## General functionality and performance

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.4](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#11404-functionality).

* Way forward guidance is mandatory for both admin and existing users. You can add way forward guidance as hyperlinks to sign up, get started, contact us, help links, or email.
* Calling out account dependency or limitations under app functionality isn't required but is mandatory to add it in both manifest long description and AppSource app listing.
* You must call out any dependency on tenant admins for new users. If there's no dependency, it's mandatory to provide a sign up, contact us, get started link, or email.

### Launching external functionality

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Apps must not take users out of Teams for core user scenarios. App content and interactions must occur within Teams capabilities, such as bots, Adaptive Cards, tabs, and task modules.
<br>
</br>

<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

* Link users within Teams app and not to an external site or app. For scenarios that require external functionality, your app must take explicit user permission to launch the functionality.

* Button UI text that launches external functionality must include content to indicate the user is taken out of the Teams instance. For example, include text such as **This way to Contoso.com** or **View in Contoso.com**.

* Add **Pop-out** icon to let the users know that they're being navigated outside Teams. You can use the pop-out icon :::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/pop-out-icon.png" ::: to the right of the link.

* If you're unable to add a **Pop-out** icon, you can implement any of the following options to let the user know that they're being navigated outside Teams:
  * Add a note in Adaptive Card that states that when users select **Get Help using this app**, it takes the user outside Teams.
  * Add interstitials dialogs.

</details>

### Compatibility

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Apps must be fully functional on the latest versions of the following operating systems and browsers:

* Microsoft Windows
* macOS
* Microsoft Edge
* Google Chrome
* iOS
* Android

Your app must show a graceful failure message on unsupported browsers and operating systems.

### Response time

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Teams apps must respond within a reasonable timeframe or show a loading or typing indicator or message or warning.

* Tabs must respond within two seconds or display a loading message or warning.
* Bots must respond to user commands within two seconds or display a typing indicator.
* Message extensions must respond to user commands within two seconds.
* Notifications must display within two seconds of the user action.

## App package and store listing

[*Mandatory Fix*]

App packages must be correctly formatted and include all required information and components.

> [!TIP]
>
> * You must ensure the provided test accounts or test environment is valid in perpetuity, that is till the app is live on the commercial marketplace.
> * You must include the following detailed testing instructions for validating your app submission:
>
>   * **Steps to configure the app test accounts** in case app depends on external accounts for authentication.
>   * Summary of **expected app behavior** for the core workflows within Teams.
>   * **Clearly describe Limitations**, conditions, or exceptions to the functionality, features, and deliverables in the app long description and related materials.
>   * **Emphasis on any considerations** for testers while validating your app submission.
>   * **Pre-populate the test accounts with dummy data** to aid testing.
>   * If you are providing your test accounts, ensure that you enable third-party integration. Also, disable two-factor or multi-factor authentication.

### App manifest

[*Mandatory Fix*]

The Teams app manifest defines your app's configuration.

* Your manifest must conform to a publicly released manifest schema. For more information, see [manifest reference](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md). Don't submit your app using a preview version of the manifest.
* If your app includes a bot or message extension, details in the app manifest must be consistent with Bot Framework metadata including bot name, logo, privacy policy link, and terms of service link.
* If your app uses Azure Active Directory for authentication, include the Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Application (client) ID in the manifest. For more information, see the [manifest reference](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#webapplicationinfo).

### Uses of Latest manifest schema

* If your app uses Single sign-on (SSO), you must declare Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) ID in the manifest for user authentication. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* You must use a publicly released manifest schema. You can update your app package to use a public version of manifest schema 1.10 or later. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* When you submit an app update, only increase the app version number. App ID of the updated app must match the App ID of the published app. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* The presence of additional files within the app package isn't acceptable. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* The version number must be the same in the manifest file schema and additional languages manifest schema. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* You must use the Teams manifest schema version 1.5 or later to localize your app. To use the app schema version 1.5 or later in your manifest.json file, update the `$schema` attribute to 1.5 or later. Update the `manifestVersion` property to `$schema` version (1.5 in this case). [*Mandatory Fix*]

* When you add, update, or remove an existing capability, add or remove manifest or Partner Center metadata, you must increase the app version number and submit the new app manifest in your Partner Center account for validation.

* The version string must follow the Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer) standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app requires admins to review permissions and grant consent in Teams admin center, you must declare `webapplicationinfo` in the manifest. If `webapplicationinfo` isn't declared in the manifest, the **Permissions** page for your app in Teams admin center is shown as **...** [*Mandatory Fix*]

* As part of Teams app certification, you must submit a production version of the app manifest. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* We recommend that you declare the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) ID in the manifest. The MPN ID helps identify the partner organization that builds the app. [*Suggested Fix*]

### App icons

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Icons are one of the main elements people see when browsing the Teams store.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Your icons must communicate your app's brand and purpose while adhering to the following requirements:

* Your app package must include two .png versions of your app icon: A color icon and an outline icon.
* The color version of your icon must be 192x192 pixels. Your icon symbol can be any color or colors, but it must sit on a solid or fully transparent square background.
* The outline version of your icon is displayed in the following scenarios:
  * When your app is in use and **hosted** on the app bar on the left side of Teams.
  * When a user pins your app's message extension.

* The outline must be 32x32 pixels and can be white with a transparent background or transparent with a white background. The icon must not have any extra padding around the symbol.

* Your app package must include correctly sized and formatted icons. The icons must match the information in store listing metadata.

For more information, see [icon guidelines](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md#app-icons).

</details>

### App descriptions

You must have a short and long description for your app. The descriptions in your app configuration and Partner Center must be the same.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-adequete-information.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of adequete app descriprion in the Teams app.":::

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-inadequete.png" alt-text="Graphic shows a failed scenario for an inadequete app description.":::

<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Descriptions must not directly or through insinuation disparage another brand (Microsoft owned or otherwise). Ensure that your description doesn't include claims that can't be substantiated. For example, **Guaranteed 200 percent increase in efficiency**.

* App description must not contain comparative marketing information. For example, don't use competitor logos or trademarks in the offer listing including tags or other metadata that references competing offers or marketplaces. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-comparitive-marketing-fail.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of comparative marketing information in app description.":::

* Hyperlink contact details, get started, help, or sign up in app description.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-contact-deatils-hyperlinked.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of contact details hyperlinked in the app descriptions.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-contact-deatils-not-hyperlinked.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of contact details not hyperlinked in the app descriptions.":::

* App description must identify the intended audience, briefly and clearly explain its unique and distinct value, identify supported Microsoft products and other software, and include any prerequisites or requirements for its use. You must clearly describe any limitations, conditions or exceptions to the functionality, features, and deliverables as described in the listing and related materials before the customer acquires your offer. The capabilities you declare must relate to the core functions and description of your offer. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If you update your app name, replace the old app name with new app name in the offer metadata in the manifest, AppSource, and wherever applicable. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Limitations and account dependencies must be called out in the manifest App Description, AppSource, and Partner Center. For example:
  * Enterprise account
  * Paid subscription
  * Another license or account
  * Language
  * Public switched telephone network (PSTN) dialing
  * Regional dependency
  * Lead time for booking translators or live agents
  * Role based functionality
  * Dependency on native app

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-limitations-calledout-pass.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of limitations called out in app description.":::
  
  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-limitations-not-calledout-fail.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of limitations not called out in app descriptions.":::

* If your app is supported for specific regions or geographical locations, you must call out that specific region dependency in the app description in manifest, Partner Center, and AppSource for that offer.

* If you need to reference Teams, write the first reference in the app listing as Microsoft Teams. Later references can be shortened to Teams.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-teams-reference-fail.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of incorrect reference to Teams in app description.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-teams-reference-pass.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of correct reference to Teams in app description.":::

#### Short description

A short description is a concise summary of your app that highlights its value proposition and is directed at your target audience.

**Dos:**

* Keep the short description to one sentence.
* Put the most important information first.
* Include keywords that customers are likely to search for.
* Make efficient use of the available character limit. For example, don't repeat your app name.

**Don't:**

[*Suggested Fix*]

Use the word **app** in the short description.

#### Long description

The long description can provide an engaging narrative that highlights your app's value proposition, primary audience, and target industry. While this description can be as long as 4,000 characters, most users will only read between 300-500 words.

**Dos:**

* Use [Markdown](https://support.office.com/article/use-markdown-formatting-in-teams-4d10bd65-55e2-4b2d-a1f3-2bebdcd2c772) to format your description.

* Use active voice and speak to users directly. For example, **You can ...**.

* List features with bullet points so it's easier to scan the description.

* Clearly describe limitations, features, conditions or exceptions to the functionality, and deliverables in the listing and related materials before the user installs your app. The Teams capabilities must relate to the core functions described in the listing.

* Ensure that the app description matches with the functionality available inside Teams app. Any reference to workflows outside the Teams app must be limited and distinctly called out from the Teams app functionality.

* Include a help or support link.

* Refer to **Microsoft 365** instead of **Office 365**.

* Use the following language when describing how the app works with Teams (or Microsoft 365):
  * **... works with Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... working with Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... within Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... for Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... integrated with Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... built for...**
  * **... developed for...**
  * **.. designed for...**

**Don'ts:**

[*Mandatory Fix*]

* Exceed 500 words.
* Abbreviate **Microsoft** as **MS** or **MSFT**.

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-microsoft-abbreviated.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of abbreviating Microsoft as MS or MSFT  for the first time in app description.":::

* Indicate the app is an offering from Microsoft, including using Microsoft slogans or taglines.

### Screenshots

Screenshots provide a prominent visual preview of your app to complement your app name, icon, and descriptions.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Remember the following:

* You can have up to five screenshots per listing.
* Supported file types include PNG, JPEG, and GIF.
* Dimensions must be 1366x768 pixels.
* Maximum size of 1,024 KB.

**Dos:**

* Focus on your app's capabilities. For example, how people can communicate with your bot.
* Include content that accurately represents your app.
* Use text judiciously.
* Frame screenshots with a color that reflects your brand and include marketing content.
* Use high-resolution screenshots that are sharp and contain legible and clearly readable text. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Use mockups that accurately depict the app’s actual UI for the benefit of end-users. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Provide at least three screenshots in your app’s marketplace listing.
* If your Teams app is extensible to other Microsoft 365 hubs, the screenshots provided must depict the app functionality in other Microsoft 365 hubs.
* At least one screenshot must depict your app’s functionality on mobile devices.
* We recommend that you provide captions in your screenshots to let the user clearly understand the app capability.

**Don'ts:**

* Include mockups that inaccurately reflect your app's actual UI, such as showing your app being used outside Teams.

> [!TIP]
>
> * A video can be the most effective way to communicate why people must use your app. A video also is the first thing users see in your listing.
> * If you choose to provide a video in your app listing, you must turn off ads in YouTube or Vimeo settings before submitting the video link in the Partner Center. Videos provided in the app listing must not be more than 90 seconds in duration and must only depict the app functionality and integration with Microsoft Teams. For more information, see [create a video for your store listing](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/submission-checklist.md#create-a-video).

</details>

### Privacy policy

[*Mandatory Fix*]

The privacy policy can be specific to your Teams app or an overall policy for all your services.

* If you use a generic privacy policy template, you must add a reference to **services**, **applications**, or **platforms in the scope of your privacy policy**. You don’t need to specify your Teams app in the scope, if you include a reference to **services**, **applications** and **platforms**. The app validation process will interpret these references to include your Teams app along with your other services or websites.
* Must include how you handle user data storage, retention, and deletion. You must describe the security controls for data protection.
* Must include your contact information.
* Must not include URLs that are broken or for beta or staging purposes.
* Must not include links to AppSource.
* Must not require authentication to access privacy policy.
* Must not include any commerce UI or store links.

### Terms of use

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Use the following guidelines to write the Terms of use:

* Must be specific and applicable to your offering.
* Must be hosted on your own domain.
* Must have a secure (HTTPS) link.
* Access to Terms of use must not require authentication.

### Support links

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Your app's support URLs must not require authentication. For example, users must not login to contact you.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Support URLs must include your contact details or a way forward for users to raise a support ticket. For example, if your support URL is hosted on GitHub, the GitHub page must be under your ownership and must include your contact details or a way forward for users to raise a support ticket.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-supportlinks-authentication.png" alt-text="validation-support-links-auth":::

</details>

### Localization

[*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app supports localization, your app package must include a file with language translations that display based on the Teams language setting. The file must conform to the Teams localization schema. For more information, see [Teams localization schema](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-localization.md).

* App metadata content must be the same in `en-us` and other localization languages. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Supported languages must be displayed in the AppSource app description. For example, this app is available in X (X= localized language). [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If the user's client settings don't match with any of your additional languages, the default language is used as the final fallback language. Update the `localizationInfo` property with the correct default language that your application supports. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Update the `localizationInfo` property with the correct default language your application supports or add localized content for manifest and Partner Center long and short description. [*Mandatory Fix*]

## Apps linked to SaaS offer

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.5](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies?branch=pr-en-us-5673). If you're building a Teams app linked to a SaaS offer, ensure that it adheres to these guidelines.
<br></br>
<details><summary>General</summary>

* ISVs must support the ability for multiple users (Subscribers) in the same tenant to manage their own subscription and assign licenses to users in the tenant.
* The offer must meet all the [technical requirements](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/include-saas-offer) for Teams apps linked to a SaaS offer.
* The Teams apps linked to SaaS offer must meet all the requirements defined in [1000 Software as a Service (SaaS)](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1000-software-as-a-service-saas).
* `subscriptionOffer` details mentioned in the manifest file must be correct. In your app manifest, add or update node `subscriptionOffer` with value `publisherId.offerId`. For example, if your publisher ID is `contoso1234` and your offer ID is `offer01`, the value that you specify in your app manifest must be `contoso1234.offer01`.
* Linked SaaS offer to the Teams app must be live in AppSource and preview offers aren't accepted for store approval.

</details>

</br>
<details><summary>Offer metadata</summary>

* Offer metadata must match across the Teams manifest, the Teams app listing in AppSource, and the SaaS offer in AppSource.
* Teams app and SaaS offer must be from the same publisher or developer. The SaaS offer referenced in the App manifest must belong to the same publisher as the Teams app is submitted to the commercial marketplace.
* As your submitted offer is a Teams app linked to SaaS offer, you must select **Additional purchases** as **Yes, my product requires purchase of a service or offers additional in-app purchases​** in Partner Center product set-up section of your offer listing.
* Plan descriptions and pricing details must provide enough information for users to clearly understand the offer listings.
* Any limitations, dependencies on additional services and exceptions to features offered must be accurately called out in plan descriptions.
* The Teams apps linked to SaaS offer are designed to support licenses assigned on a named, per-user basis. Sometimes, the SaaS offer is built with other method or has specialized purchase flows. You must clearly mention in the app metadata and subscription plan details about the method and purchase flows.
* SaaS offer must provide messages and guidance to all users in all applicable states of purchase flow.

</details>
</br>

* Guide users on how to add the app to Teams and get started through Teams chat bot or email.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Usability and functionality</summary>

* After successful purchase and assignment of licenses, you must provide the following:
  * Access to users for subscribed plan features.
  * Value addition and significant benefits of subscription plan to users.
  * From your Teams app, provide link to the SaaS application home page for subscribers to manage the licenses in the future.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Configure and test SaaS application</summary>

If setup of your app for testing purposes is complex, provide an end-to-end functional document, linked SaaS offer configuration steps, and instructions for license and user management as part of your *Notes for Certification*.

> [!TIP]
> You can add a video on how your app and license management works to assist the team for testing.

## Tabs

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.4.2](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114042-tabs).
If your app includes a tab, ensure that it adheres to these guidelines.
> [!TIP]
> For more information on creating a high-quality app experience, see [Teams tab design guidelines](~/tabs/design/tabs.md).

</br>
<details><summary>Setup</summary>

* Tab setup **must not dead-end** a new user. Provide a message on how to complete the action or workflow. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tabs-setup-create-new-account.png" alt-text="validation-tabs-setup-create-new-acc":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tabs-setup-new-user.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of Tab with a dead-end on setup.":::

* The user must not leave the tab configuration experience inside Teams to create content outside Teams and then return to Teams to pin it. Tab configuration screen must explain the value of configuration and how to configure. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tabs-setup-profile-name.png" alt-text="validation-tabs-set-up-profile-name":::

* Tab configuration screen must not embed an entire website. Keep your configuration experience focused. For example, if you're building a project management app that lets users configure a project in a channel, keep the tab configuration screen focused on allowing the user to select a project from your app to configure in the channel. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tabs-setup-configuration-experience.png" alt-text="validation-tabs-setup-configuration-exp":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tabs-setup-configuration-screen.png" alt-text="validation-tabs-set-up-configuration-screen":::

* Apps that require users to input a URL while configuring a tab must:
  * Provide an appropriate way forward guidance for the user to acquire or generate the URL. [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * Check for URL that is relevant or appropriate to the app’s functionality as per the app description. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tab-configuration-way-forward-url-pass.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of tab configuration with a way forward for user to generate a URL.":::
  
    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tab-configuration-way-forward-url-fail.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of tab configuration without a way forward for user to generate a URL.":::

* Hyperlink the contact us information in the configuration screen instead of plain text to help users to contact you for support requirements. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* For a seamless first run user experience, we recommend that you hyperlink your support URL or email in the configuration screen. [*Suggested Fix*]

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Views</summary>

* The sign in screen area must not use large logos. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-views-applogin.png" alt-text="validation-views-app-login":::

* Content can be simplified by breaking down across multiple tabs.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-views-multiple-tabs.png" alt-text="val-views-multiple-tabs":::

* Tabs shouldn't have a duplicate header. Remove duplicate logos from the I-frame since the tab framework already displays the app icon and name. [*Suggested Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-views-no-duplicate-header-logo.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of a tab without duplicate headers and logos.":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-views-duplicate-header-logo.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of a tab with duplicate headers and logos.":::

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Navigation</summary>

The following are the navigation guidelines:

* Tabs must not provide navigation that conflicts with the primary Teams navigation. If you provide a left navigation in your tab, it must not include only icons or icons with stacked text. It must not be a collapsible rail with the option to see icons with stacked text (mimicking the Teams navigation bar). Include icons with inline text or only text or use hamburger menus instead of tab left rail. [*Mandatory Fix*]

Design your app with [basic](~/concepts/design/design-teams-app-basic-ui-components.md) and [advanced](~\concepts\design\design-teams-app-advanced-ui-components.md) Fluent UI components.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-static-tab.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of navigation in a tab that does not conflict with the primary Teams navigation.":::

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-collapsable-left-rail.png" alt-text="validation-nav-collapsable-left-rail":::

* Tabs with toolbar in left rail must leave 20 pixels spacing from Teams left navigation. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-spacing-between-toolbar.png" alt-text="validation-nav-spacing-between-toolbar":::

* The secondary and tertiary pages in a tab must be opened in a level two (L2) and level three (L3) view in the main tab area, which is navigated via breadcrumbs or left navigation. You can also use the following components to aid navigation in a tab:
  * Back buttons
  * Page headers
  * Hamburger menus

* Deep links in tabs must not link to an external webpage but within Teams. For example, task modules or other tabs. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-view-button-not-linked-static-tab.png" alt-text="validation-nav-view-button-not-linked-static-tab":::

* Tabs must not allow users to navigate outside Teams for the core app experience. Tabs can redirect outside Teams for non-core workflows. For example, to raise a support ticket. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-core-workflow-within-configuration.png" alt-text="validation-nav-core-workflow-within-configuration":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-core-workflow-redirects-outside.png" alt-text="validation-nav-core-workflow-redirects-outside":::

* Horizontal scroll must not be present in an in-meeting tab. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* In-meeting dialogs used in your app must not allow horizontal scrolling. Use in-meeting dialogs sparingly and for scenarios that are light and task oriented. You can specify the width of the in-meeting dialog’s I-frame within the supported size range to account for different scenarios. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Task modules used in your app must not allow horizontal scrolling. Task modules allow you to select different sizes to make the content responsive without the need of Horizontal scroll. If required, you can use a Stage View (a full screen UI component to surface your web content) to complete the workflow without Horizontal scroll. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Horizontal scroll present in the tab in a personal chat, channel, and in-meeting details tab in any scope is not allowed if the entire tab canvas is scrollable, unless your tab uses an infinite canvas with fixed UI elements. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Horizontal scroll in Adaptive Cards must not be present in Teams. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bottom rail used for navigation in tabs must not conflict with Teams native mobile app navigation. [*Mandatory Fix*]

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tab-bottom-rail-conflicts-with-teams-mobile.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of a tab that conflicts with Teams native mobile app navigation.":::

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Usability</summary>

* Tabs must provide value beyond hosting an existing website. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-usability-app-provides-workflows.png" alt-text="validation-usability-app-provides-work-flows":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-usability-teams-app-identical-website.png" alt-text="validation-usability-teams-app-identical-websites":::

* Content must not truncate or overlap within the tab.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-usability-content-truncation.png" alt-text="validation-usability-content-truncations":::

* Users must be able to undo their last action in the tab.

* Tabs in a personal context may aggregate content from shared instances of the app. For example, a project management app with a configurable tab that lets channel members comment on the project on Kanban cards, must aggregate this content and display in the personal app. [*Suggested Fix*]

* Tabs must be responsive to Teams themes. When a user changes the theme, the app's theme must reflect the selection.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-usability-responsive-tabs.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of a tab responsive to a theme in Teams.":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-usability-unresponsive-tabs.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of a Tab not responsive to theme in Teams.":::

* Tabs must use Teams styled components such as, Teams fonts, type ramps, color palettes, grid system, motion, tone of voice, whenever possible. For more information, see [tab design guidelines](/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/design/tabs). [*Suggested Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-usability-app-uses-diff-font.png" alt-text="validation-usability-app-uses-font":::

* If your app functionality requires changes in settings, include a **Settings** tab. [*Suggested Fix*]
* Tabs must follow Teams interaction design such as, in-page navigation, position and use of dialogs, information hierarchies. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Fluent UI kit](~/concepts/design/design-teams-app-basic-ui-components.md).

* Tab experiences must be fully responsive on mobile (Android and iOS).

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > * Include a personal bot alongside a personal tab.
   > * Allow users to share content from their personal tab.

* Tab must not contain elements that completely obstruct or impede workflows within the tab. For example, bot inside a tab that can't be minimized.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tab-elements-impede-workflow.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of tab with elements that impede workflows within the tab.":::

* Tab must not have a broken functionality. Your offer must be a usable software solution and must provide the functionality, features, and deliverables as described in your listing and other related materials. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your tabs contain a footer, ensure that you remove all links unrelated to app functionality from the footer.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Scope selection</summary>

* Content in the landing page of configurable tabs must not be scoped for individual use and not include personal content such as **My Tasks** or **My Dashboard**.

* After the configuration experience, the landing page must show a collaborative view for the entire team.

* If your app requires provision of a personal scope view for the user to enhance efficiency or workplace productivity, use filtered views, deep links to personal apps, or navigate to L2 or L3 views within the configurable tab and keep the landing page contextually the same for all the users.

* Content in the landing page of the configurable tabs must be contextually same for all members of the channel.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-usability-configurable-tab-personal-info.png" alt-text="validation-usability-configurable-tab-pers-info":::

## Bots

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.4.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114043-bots).

If your app includes a bot, ensure that it adheres to these guidelines.

> [!TIP]
> For more information on creating a high-quality app experience, see [Teams bot design guidelines](~/bots/design/bots.md).

</br>
<details><summary>Bot design guidelines</summary>

* Your Teams app must follow [Teams bot design guidelines](../../../../bots/design/bots.md).

* You must implement a task module to avoid multi-turn bot response when the workflow involves the user performing repetitive tasks. For example, use a task module to repetitively capture name, dob, place, and designation instead of using multi-turn conversations. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Any broken links, responses, or workflows in your app must be fixed. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</details>

</br>
<details><summary>Bot commands</summary>

Analyzing user input and predicting user intent is difficult. Bot commands provide users a set of words or phrases for your bot to understand.

* You must list at least one supported bot command in the `{commandList}` section of your app manifest. These commands display in the compose box when a user tries to message your bot.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-commands-listed.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of bot commands listed in the app manifest.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-commands-not-listed.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of bot commands not listed in the app manifest.":::

* All commands that your bot supports must work correctly, including generic commands such as **Hi**, **Hello**, and **Help**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-commands-deadend.png" alt-text="validation-bot-commands-dead-end":::

* You must list at least one valid bot command in the `items.commands.title` section of the manifest and add a suitable description that gives clarity to the user on the bot command and its usage. Bot commands listed in the `commandLists` section of the manifest surface as pre-populated commands in the bot command menu and provide a way forward for the new user to interact with the bot. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bot response must not contain any official Microsoft product images or avatars. Use your own assets in your app. Use of Microsoft product images in your app isn't allowed. You may only copy, modify, distribute, display, license, or sell Microsoft copyrighted product images if you're granted explicit permission within the End-User License Agreement (EULA), license terms that accompany the content, or in the [Microsoft Trademark and Brand guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks). [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bots must respond to user commands without displaying a continuous loading indicator. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bot help command response must not redirect the user outside Teams. Bot help command response can redirect user to a canvas within the Teams app or provide a way forward response in an Adaptive Card. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bots must always provide a valid response to a user input even if the input is irrelevant or improper. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bots must not contain duplicate commands. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bots must not display a typing indicator after responding to the user command, but can display a typing indicator while responding to the user command. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bots must provide a valid response to the **help** command typed in lowercase or uppercase that provides the user with a way forward or lets the user access the help content related to the bot usage. Bots must provide a valid response even when the user hasn't logged onto the app. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-help-command.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of bot sending a valid response to help command.":::

* Bot responses on mobile must be responsive without any data truncation that hampers the end-user's bot usage  to complete desired workflows. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* All the links in a bot response adaptive card must be responsive. Any link that takes the user outside the Teams platform must have a clear redirect text such as, **View in..** or **This way to..**, a pop-out icon in the bot response action button, or have a suitable redirect text in the bot response message body. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* By design, if your bot doesn't respond or support any user command and is a one way bot only intended to notify users. You must set `isNotificationOnly` to true in the manifest. [*Mandatory Fix*]

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-command-isnotification-only-not-true.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of notification only bot not responding for a users message.":::

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-command-isnotification-only-true.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of notification only property set to true in the app manifest.":::

* Bot user experience must not be broken on mobile platforms. Your bot must be fully responsive on mobile. [*Mandatory Fix*]

> [!TIP]
> For personal bots, include a **Help** tab that further describes what your bot can do.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Bot welcome messages</summary>

* If the app has a complex configuration flow (requires an enterprise license or lacks an intuitive sign up flow), then bots in such apps must always send a welcome message during the first run.

  For best experience, the welcome message must include the value offered by the bot to users, who installed the bot in channel, how to configure the bot, and briefly describe all supported bot commands. You can display the welcome message using an Adaptive Card with buttons for better usability. For more information, see [how to trigger a bot welcome message](~/bots/how-to/conversations/send-proactive-messages.md). For apps without a complex configuration flow, you can choose to trigger a welcome message during the bot first run experience. However, if a welcome message is triggered, it must follow the welcome message guidelines.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-welcome-message.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of bot sending a welcome message when the bot has a complex configuration workflow.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-no-welcome-message.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of bot not sending a welcome message when the bot has a complex configuration workflow.":::

* Bot welcome messages in channels and chats are optional during first run, especially if the bot is available for personal use and performs similar actions. Your bot must not send welcome messages to users individually (it's considered [spamming](#botmessagespamming)). The message must also mention the person who added the bot.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-welcome-message-not-triggered.png" alt-text="validation-bot-welcome-message-not-trigger":::

* Bot installed in a channel or group chat scope must not allow users to start individual workflows. Bots must complete individual workflows in 1:1 chat with the user. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bot welcome message must clearly call out the limitations related to bot usage in the installed scope. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Welcome message must auto trigger on app install in a personal scope. If the bot doesn't send a welcome message in a personal scope, the user is lead to a dead-end. If the app doesn't include a complex configuration workflow, it's optional for the developer to trigger a welcome message in the channel or group chat scope. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Welcome message must not contain links to any app marketplace including AppSource. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app has a complex configuration workflow that requires admin led installation, doesn't have an intuitive and readily available sign up flow, or requires users to complete configuration steps outside the Teams experience and return then the bot must send a proactive welcome message in a team or group chat scope after installation. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your bot sends a welcome message in the channel, it must not send it to users individually (It's considered spamming). The welcome message must also mention the person who added the bot. [*Suggested Fix*]

<details><summary><a id="botmessagespamming">Bot message spamming</a></summary>

Bots must not spam users by sending multiple messages in short duration.

* **Bot messages in channels and chats**: Don't spam users by creating separate posts. Create a single post with replies in the same thread.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-message-spamming-one-message.png" alt-text="validation-bot-message-spam-one-message":::

* **Bot messages in personal apps**:
  * Don't send multiple messages in quick succession.
  * Send one message with complete information.
  * Avoid multi-turn conversations to complete a single repetitive workflow.
  * Use a form (or task module) to collect all inputs from a user at one time.
  * NLP based conversational chatbots can use multi turn conversation to make the discussion more engaging and complete a workflow.

<details><summary>Bot notifications</summary>

Bot notifications must include content relevant for the scope you define for the bot (team, chat, or personal).

</details>
</br>
<details><summary>Bots and Adaptive Cards</summary>

Adaptive Cards are a highly recommended way to display bot messages. The cards must be lightweight and only include up to six actions. To display more content, consider using a task module or tab.

For more information about cards, see:

* [Designing Adaptive Cards](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/design-effective-cards.md)
* [Cards reference](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.md#types-of-cards)

Bot experience must be fully responsive on mobile. Bot responses must provide a way forward where applicable. Bot musts be responsive and fail with a graceful error message for failures. Bot messages sent in the personal scope to user's base on triggers in a collaborative scope must provide contextual information (including the message’s origin).

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Notification only bots</summary>

Apps that consist of notification only bots provide user value by triggering user notifications based on certain triggers or events in the core app or backend. For example, a new sales lead or prospect is added for the sales team to follow up on. A high-quality notification only bot notifies the users regularly on certain event completions such as workflow completions or alerts.

A notification provides value in Teams if:

1. Posted card or text provides adequate details requiring no further user action.
1. Posted card or text provides adequate preview information for a user to take action or decide to view further details in a link opening outside Teams.

Apps that provide only notifications with content such as, **You have a new notification**, **click to view** and require the user to navigate outside Teams for everything else don't provide significant value within Teams.

</details>
<br/>

<details><summary>Bot metadata information</summary>

* Bot information in the app manifest (bot name, logo, privacy link, and terms of service link) must be consistent with the Bot Framework metadata. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bot ID must match in the app manifest and Bot Framework metadata. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Ensure that the bot ID in the app manifest matches with bot ID in the last store published version of your app. Changing bot IDs in an app update leads to permanent loss of all user interaction history with the bot for existing users of your app and starts a new conversation chain with the new Bot ID. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Any change to app name, metadata, bot welcome message, or bot responses must be updated with new name. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* App name in the bot welcome message or bot responses must match the app name in the manifest. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</details>
<br/>

<details><summary>Bot in collaborative scope</summary>

* Bot installation in a channel or group chat scope to obtain the team roster for sending proactive notifications for users as 1:1 chats for team specific triggers isn't allowed. For example, app that pairs people for a meetup. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bot in channel or group chat only used to obtain the messages or posts in Channel or group chat for sending proactive notifications for users as 1:1 chats isn't allowed. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bots installed in collaborative scope must provide a user value in the collaborative scope. [*Mandatory Fix*]

## Message extensions

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.4.4](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114044-messaging-extensions).

If your app includes a message extension, ensure that it adheres to these guidelines.

> [!TIP]
> For more information on creating a high-quality app experience, see the [Teams message extension design guidelines](~/messaging-extensions/design/messaging-extension-design.md).

<br/>

<details><summary>Messaging extensions design guidelines</summary>

* If your Teams app uses the messaging extension capability, your app must follow the [Messaging extension design guidelines](../../../../messaging-extensions/design/messaging-extension-design.md).

* Messaging extensions are shortcuts for inserting app content or acting on a message without navigating away from the conversation. Keep your messaging extension simple and display only the components required to effectively complete the action. Complete website must not be I-framed within the messaging extension [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Preview images in Adaptive Cards in messaging extensions must load properly. [*Mandatory Fix*]

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-preview-image-adaptive-card-loading.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of preview image loading in adaptive card.":::

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-preview-image-adaptive-card-not-loading.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of preview image not loading in adaptive card.":::

* Messaging extension response card must include the app icon to avoid end user confusion. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Your app must not have any broken functionality. App must not dead-end or block the user from completing a workflow in a messaging extension. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Messaging extensions must respond or work as intended in group chat and channel scopes. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* You must include a way for the user to sign in or sign out from the messaging extension. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Action commands for Action-based message extensions</summary>

Action-based message extensions must do the following:

* Allow users to trigger actions on a message without completing intermediate steps, such as sign in.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-messaging-extension-no-intermediate-step.png" alt-text="validation-messaging-extension-no-intermediate-steps":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-messaging-extension-intermediate-step-available.png" alt-text="validation-messaging-extension-intermediate-steps-available":::

* Pass the message context to the next work state. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-messaging-extension-app-doesnot-pass-message.png" alt-text="validation-messaging-extension-app-doesnot-pass-messages":::

* Incorporate the host app name instead of a generic verb for action commands triggered from a chat message, channel post, or call to action within apps. For example, use **Start a Skype Meeting** for **Start Meeting**, **Upload file to DocuSign** for **Upload file**. [*Suggested Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-messaging-extension-action-command-host-name.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of host app name for an action command.":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-messaging-extension-action-command-verb.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of generic verb for an action command.":::

* Invoking a message action must allow the user to complete the workflow. Errors, blank responses, or continuous loading indicators to make the message action functional as intended must not be present. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Duplicate action commands must not be present. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Message actions must allow the user to complete the workflow as intended without an invalid response. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Apps with only action-based messaging extension must have the following end state:

  * Post a relevant action as a notification either in the context where message extension is invoked or in 1:1 bot chat based on user scenario. [*Mandatory Fix*]

  * Allow users to share cards with other users based on the action taken. This is to ensure that apps don't take silent actions. For example, a ticket is created based on a message in a channel, but the app doesn't send a notification or doesn't provide a way to request the user to share ticket details after the ticket is created. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Preview links (link unfurling)</summary>

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Message extensions must preview recognized links in the Teams compose box. Don't add domains that are outside your control (either absolute URLs or wildcards). For example, `yourapp.onmicrosoft.com` is valid but `*.onmicrosoft.com` isn't valid. Top-level domains also are prohibited. For example, `*.com` or `*.org`. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Search commands</summary>

* Search based message extensions must provide text that helps the users to search effectively. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-search-commands-text-available.png" alt-text="validation-search-command-text-available":::

* @mention executables must be clear, easy to understand, and readable.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Action commands for Search based message extension</summary>

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Apps that consist of search-based message extension provide user value by sharing cards that allow for contextual conversations without context switching.

To pass validation for a search-based message extension only app, the following are required as baseline to ensure that the user experience isn't broken. A card shared via a message extension provides value in Teams if:

1. Posted card provides adequate details requiring no further user action.
1. Posted card provides adequate preview information for a user to take action or decide to view further details in a link opening outside Teams.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-search-based-messaging-ext-adequete-info.png" alt-text="validation-search-base-messaging-ext-adequete-info":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-search-based-messaging-ext-inadequete-info.png" alt-text="validation-search-base-messaging-ext-inadequete-info":::

Link unfurling only apps don't provide significant value within Teams. Consider building additional workflows in your app, if your app only supports link unfurling and has no other functionality.

</details>

## Task modules

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is inline with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.4.5](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114045-task-modules).
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

A task module must include an icon and the short name of the app it's associated with. Task modules must not embed an entire app and only display the components required to complete a specific action.

For more information, see [Teams task module design guidelines](~\task-modules-and-cards\task-modules\design-teams-task-modules.md).

</br>
<details><summary>Meeting extension design guidelines</summary>

* Your Teams apps must follow [Meeting extension design guidelines](../../../../apps-in-teams-meetings/design/designing-apps-in-meetings.md).

* With the in-meeting app experience, you can engage participants during the meeting by using in-meeting tabs, dialog box, and the in-meeting share to stage feature. If your app supports Teams meeting extension, you must provide a responsive in-meeting experience aligned with the Teams meeting experience. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* With the pre-meeting app experience, users can find and add meeting apps. Users can also do pre-meeting tasks such as developing a poll to survey the meeting participants. An app that provides a pre-meeting experience must be relevant to the meeting workflow and offer value to the user. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* With post-meeting app experience, users can view the results of the meeting such as, poll survey results or feedback and other app content. An app that provides a post-meeting experience must be relevant to the workflow of the meeting and offer value to the user. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* With the in-meeting app experience, you can engage meeting participants during the meeting and enhance the meeting experience for all the attendees. Attendees must not be taken outside the Teams meeting to complete core user workflows of the app. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Your app must offer value beyond providing only custom Together Mode scenes in Teams. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* You must declare `groupChat` as a scope under `configurableTabs` and `meetingDetailsTab`, `meetingChatTab`, and `meetingSidePanel` as a context property in the manifest to enable your app for meetings on Teams mobile. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Meeting canvases must not dead-end a meeting attendee. Meeting canvases must show a graceful failure message for app limitations such as, region specific dependency. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* The meeting canvas’ header must display the correct app name to avoid confusing the meeting attendee. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* You must include an option for the user to sign out or log out from the meeting extension. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Meeting tabs on mobile platforms must include relevant workflows. Blank pages must not be present in a meeting tab. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Meeting stage is a focused, intuitive, and collaborative participation canvas. Meeting stage must not embed the complete website experience. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* App must not show continuous loading screen, error, or broken functionality that dead-ends the user or blocks completion of a workflow in a meeting scenario. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* App must not open a new Teams instance on starting a meeting. Meeting canvases are an extension of the Teams capabilities that promote real time collaboration and new meetings must always open within the currently active Teams instance. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Meeting apps must complete workflows within the Microsoft Teams platform without redirecting to competitor chat based platforms. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app supports role based views and certain workflows are unavailable to all participants, we recommend that you implement proper messaging for participants in tab and side-panel stating that the app is currently for organizer's view and provide details about how the attendees will receive the meeting notes, action items, and update agendas. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</details>
<br/>

<details><summary>General</summary>

Use the following guidelines for meeting extensions:

* Meeting extensibility apps must offer a responsive in-meeting experience aligned to the Teams meeting experience. In-meeting experience is mandatory for a Teams app that supports meeting extensibility but, pre and post-meeting experiences aren't mandatory.

  * With the pre-meeting app experience, users can find and add meeting apps. Users can also perform pre-meeting tasks such as developing a poll to survey the meeting participants. If your app provides a pre-meeting experience, it must be relevant to the workflow of the meeting.

  * With the post-meeting app experience, users can view the results of the meeting such as, poll survey results or feedback and other app content. If your app provides a post-meeting experience, it must be relevant to the workflow of the meeting.

  * With the in-meeting app experience, you can engage meeting participants during the meeting and enhance the meeting experience for all the attendees. Attendees must not be taken outside the Teams meeting for completing core user workflows of your app.

* Your app must offer value beyond providing custom Together Mode scenes in Teams.

* Shared meeting stage feature can only be launched through the Teams desktop app. However, the shared meeting stage consumption experience must be usable and not broken when viewed on mobile devices.

> [!TIP]
> You must declare `groupChat` as a scope under `configurableTabs` and `meetingDetailsTab`, `meetingChatTab`, and `meetingSidePanel` as a context property in the manifest to enable your app for meetings on Teams mobile.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Pre and post meeting experience</summary>

* Pre and post meeting screens must adhere to general tab design guidelines. For more information, see [Teams design guidelines](~/tabs/design/tabs.md).
* Tabs must have an organized layout when displaying multiple items. For example, more than 10 polls or surveys, see [example layout](~/apps-in-teams-meetings/design/designing-apps-in-meetings.md#after-a-meeting).
* Your app must notify users when the results of a survey or poll are exported by stating, **Results successfully downloaded**.

</details>

</br>
<details><summary>In-meeting experience</summary>

* Apps must only use a dark theme during meetings. For more information, see [Teams design guidelines](~/apps-in-teams-meetings/design/designing-apps-in-meetings.md#theming).

<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

The Microsoft 365 App Compliance Program is intended to help organizations assess and manage risk by evaluating security and compliance information about your app. If you're publishing an app to the Teams store, you must complete the following tiers of the program:

* **Publisher Verification**: Helps admins and end users understand the authenticity of app developers integrating with the Microsoft identity platform. When completed, a blue **verified** badge displays on the Azure Active Directory consent dialog and other screens. For more information, see [Mark your app as publisher verified](/azure/active-directory/develop/mark-app-as-publisher-verified).

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-365-compliance-publisher-verification.png" alt-text="validation-365-compliance-publisher-verifications":::

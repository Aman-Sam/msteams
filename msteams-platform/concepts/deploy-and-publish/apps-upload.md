# Upload your app in Microsoft Teams

Uploading (aka sideloading) a custom Microsoft Teams app allows you to use an app without publishing it to your entire org or the Teams store. Sideloading makes sense in the following scenarios:

* You want to test and debug an app locally yourself or with other developers.
* You built an app just for yourself (for example, to automate a workflow).
* You built an app for a small set of users (such as your work group).

## Prerequisites

* Ensure your org has enabled [custom app uploading](~/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading) in Teams.
* [Validate your app manifest](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/appvalidation.html) for errors and create your [app package](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md).
* Make sure that your app's frontend and backend resources are running and accessible via HTTPS.

## Upload your app

You can sideload your app to a team, chat, meeting, or for personal use depending on how you configured your app's scope.

1. Log in to the Teams client with your [Microsoft 365 development account](~/build-your-first-app/build-and-run.md#prerequisites).
1. Select **Apps** and choose **Upload a custom app**.
1. Select your app package .zip file. An install dialog displays.

1. Add your app to Teams.

## Troubleshoot upload issues

If your app fails to sideload, do the following until the issue resolves:

1. Go back through the instructions for [creating your app package](../../concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md).
1. [Validate your app package](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/appvalidation.html) again.
1. Ensure your app manifest matches the latest [schema](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).

## Access your app

Teams provides several ways to open apps. For more information, see [access your apps in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/access-your-apps-in-teams-0758cb09-9e85-40e7-a974-51df7734646a).

## Update your app

You don't have to sideload your app again if you make code changes (these are reflected in Teams in real-time). However, you must reinstall if you change any app configurations.

## Remove your app

To remove your app, right click the app icon in Teams and select **Uninstall**.

> You can't remove personal bot activity entirely. If you remove the app and add it again, new communication with the bot appends to the previous conversation with it.

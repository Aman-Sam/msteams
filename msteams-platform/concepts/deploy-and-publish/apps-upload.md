# Upload your app in Microsoft Teams

You can sideload Microsoft Teams apps without having to publish to your organization or the Teams store in the following scenarios:

* You want to test and debug an app locally yourself or with other developers.
* You built an app for yourself to automate a workflow.
* You built an app for a small set of users, such as, your work group.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, sideloading apps are available in Government Community Cloud (GCC), but are not available for GCC-High and Department of Defense (DOD).

## Prerequisites

* Ensure to create your [app package](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md) and [validate it](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/appvalidation.html) for errors.
* [Enable custom app uploading](~/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading) in Teams.
* Ensure that your app is running and accessible using HTTPs.

## Upload your app

You can sideload your app to a team, chat, meeting, or for personal use depending on how you configured your app's scope.

1. Log in to the Teams client with your [Microsoft 365 development account](~/build-your-first-app/build-and-run.md#prerequisites).
1. Select **Apps** and select **Manage your apps**.
1. Select **Upload a custom app**.
1. Select your app package .zip file.
1. Select **Add** to add your app to Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select one from the dropdown list as per your requirement.

   The following screen appears when you select your app package.zip file:

## Troubleshooting

If your app fails to sideload or any issues to upload, check the following options:

1. Ensure that you have followed all the instructions for [creating your app package](../../concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md).
1. [Validate your app package](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/appvalidation.html).
1. Ensure your app manifest matches to the latest [schema](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).

## Access your app.

Teams provides several ways to open apps. For more information, see [access your apps in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/access-your-apps-in-teams-0758cb09-9e85-40e7-a974-51df7734646a).

## Update your app

You don't have to sideload your app again if you make code changes (these are reflected in Teams in real-time). However, you must reinstall if you change any app configurations.

## Remove your app

To remove your app, right click the app icon in Teams and select **Uninstall**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't remove personal bot activity entirely. If you remove the app and add it again, new communication with the bot appends to the previous conversation with it.

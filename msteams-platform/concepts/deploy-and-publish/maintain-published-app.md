# Maintain your published app

Getting your app published in the Commercial Marketplace is only the beginning!

If you have a publicly available app, then Microsoft expects you to maintain it for its entire lifecycle in the marketplace. Ensure that the app remains compliant with the Commercial Marketplace policies and Teams store validation guidelines. Maintain the highest quality experience for your customers.

## Maintain app details

You must maintain the following app details

| App details | Description |
|---|---|
| Your **app's listing** must be kept updated. | Any changes to functionality, pricing, visual appearance, or any other updates must be accurately reflected in your app's listing. |
| You must regularly update your app to ensure that it remains **compliant with the commercial marketplace policies**. | Stay up to date with policy changes by subscribing to the [changelog here](/legal/marketplace/offer-policies-change-history). |
| Your **contact details** must be kept up to date in your Partner Center account. | We'll contact you occasionally to resolve any bugs or commercial marketplace policy violations in your app. If your contact details aren't updated, you might miss important notices or updates from us. |
| Maintain your app's **functionality** and **user experience**. | Your app's functionality and user experience must match or exceed the quality of experience at submission, and you must maintain your app's performance. |

## Possible enforcement actions

Microsoft runs automated and manual continuous health checks for all the published apps. It's intended to maintain the health and end user experience of the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace and the Teams App store. In certain situations, we may contact you and remove your app from the commercial marketplace and the Teams app store, or temporarily halt new user acquisition for your app, or take further action on your app as deemed appropriate.

**We may contact you for a resolution when:**

* We're unable to run our continuous health evaluation tests on your app as the test credentials or test environment you provided have expired.

* We see or are made aware of critical security vulnerabilities in your app. These may endanger your users or the Microsoft commercial marketplace.

* We're made aware of issues with your app by your users through any of Microsoftâ€™s support channels. These issues include, but aren't limited to, spammy behavior, broken functionality, or unexpected user experience bugs and user interface bugs.

* We may also unilaterally take cognizance of issues with your app highlighted by users by means of rating and reviews for your app.

* We've identified commercial marketplace policy failures in your app as part of the continuous health evaluation of your app post publish.

If we don't receive a suitable response from you, we'll reach out to you again, and may simultaneously remove your app to protect end users. If we hear back from you, and you can confirm that issues are resolved and you've submitted an updated app for review, we'll re-list your app when the app passes review.

**We may remove your app without prior notice (other than to inform you of that action) when:**

* Microsoft receives a takedown notice for your app alleging copyright or trademark infringement.
* Your app appears to be unmaintained or abandoned and unused and there's no response from you on our reach outs.

## Discontinuing your published app

You must maintain your app's user experience as at the initial app review. If you don't maintain the app actively, or no longer wish to support the app, ensure that you discontinue your published app from your Partner Center account.

To discontinue your app:

* Remove it from Microsoft AppSource. On the **Product Overview** page in your Microsoft Partner Center account, select **Stop Selling**.
* Contact the Microsoft Teams App Health evaluation team at [apphealthevaluation@microsoft.com](mailto:apphealthevaluation@microsoft.com) or [teams-sas@microsoft.com](mailto:teams-sas@microsoft.com) to remove your app from the Microsoft Teams app store.
* Contact your customers where appropriate. Delete or revoke any security or authorization tokens generated for your app.

# Maintain your published app

Getting your app published in the Commercial Marketplace is only the beginning!

If you have a publicly available app, then Microsoft expects you to maintain it for its entire lifecycle in the marketplace. Ensure that the app remains compliant with the Commercial Marketplace policies and Teams store validation guidelines. Maintain the highest quality experience for your customers.

## Maintain app details

You must maintain the following app details

| App details | Description |
|---|---|
| Your **app's listing** must be kept updated. | Any changes to functionality, pricing, visual appearance, or any other updates must be accurately reflected in your app's listing. |
| You must regularly update your app to ensure that it remains **compliant with the commercial marketplace policies**. | Stay up to date with policy changes by subscribing to the [changelog here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/marketplace/offer-policies-change-history). |

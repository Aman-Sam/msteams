## Localized content

> [!NOTE]
> AppSource plans to support localized content for the following metadata. Currently, your app listing will only show in English in AppSource, but will display properly localized in the Teams client. See [localizing your app](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-localization.md) for more information.

|Data|Type|Size|Manifest|Seller Dashboard|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|App name|String|30|`name.short`|✔|The name for your application as it should appear in the storefront and in product.|
|Long app name|String|30|`name.full`|✔|The name for your application as it should appear in the storefront and in product.|
|Short description|String|80|`description.short`|✔|Short description of your app.|
|Long description|String|4000|`description.full`|✔|A more detailed description of your app. In the manifest file, an accurate summary is adequate. In the Seller Dashboard, you can use a richer and formatted description for AppSource product page.|

## Submission extras for bots

Bots in Microsoft Teams must be created using Bot Framework. See [Create a bot](~/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams.md) for instructions. Use a 96x96 color icon for your bot's icon in Bot Framework.

## Screenshots

The screenshots uploaded on the Seller Dashboard are displayed in both [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=office%3Bteams&page=1) and your app listing in the Teams client to provide a visual preview of your app along with your app description.

You can provide 1 to 5 screenshots. They can be .png, .jpg, or .gif files, and should be 1366x768 pixels, with a max size of 1024 KB.

Screenshots submitted on the seller dashboard should:

* Focus on highlighting all of your app's capabilities
* Not show any chrome/UI from outside of your app; do not capture any Teams or browser UI in your screenshots.
* Content should be representative of the app; do not include mock-ups that do not accurately reflect your apps actual UI such as showing your website instead of your Teams tab
* Text should be well-populated without being excessive

You can surround your screenshots with a background color and add marketing content similar to the [Freshdesk](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104381505?src=office&tab=Overview) example. In that case the dimensions are not of the screenshot, they are of the overall image.

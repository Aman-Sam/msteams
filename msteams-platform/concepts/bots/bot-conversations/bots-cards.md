# Cards in bot conversations

A *card* is a user-interface (UI) container for short or related pieces of information. Cards can have multiple properties and attachments. Teams support cards in bots, connectors and messaging extensions. See [Cards](~/concepts/cards/cards) for an overview of what cards are and how Teams uses them.

Bots use cards as part of conversations. See [Bot Conversations](~/concepts/bots/bots-conversations) for the details.

The [Teams Card Reference](~/concepts/cards/cards-reference) lists all cards supported by bots and discusses how to use them.

[Card actions](~/concepts/cards/cards-actions) lists all actions supported by cards and discusses how to use them.

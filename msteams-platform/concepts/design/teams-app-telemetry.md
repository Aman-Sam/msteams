# Teams app telemetry

After an app is distributed in an organization or in Teams App Store, it's important to track how users are interacting with the app. With growing app users, number of app installs might not be a relevant metric. Understanding how users interact with the app, the kind of audience, what they're looking for, what features are most or least used are crucial items in advising future development strategy.

App analytics help understand user behavior, motivation, friction points that can help developer make informed decisions around feature investments, enhancements, and adoption for the app.

# Plan to monetize your app

Microsoft Teams Store provides features that let you monetize your apps and gain customers by engaging with your users. Consider publishing your app on Teams Store to offer your app the best platform for global visibility. Factors such as type of app, nature of service, and target customers influence your choice for the best monetization option. Establishing a monetizing option beforehand helps guide the app design, build, and distribution decisions.

        The most common ways to monetize your app are:

        - **Subscription**: Include a Software as a service (SaaS) offer with your app to let users purchase subscription plans.
        - **In-app purchases**: Offer a free app download with limited features. For advanced features, offer an upgraded version.
        - **Free trials**: Let the users try the app for free for a set number of days or times.
        - **Test preview**: Preview and test a SaaS offer before you publish your app.

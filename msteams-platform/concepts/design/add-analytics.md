# Add analytics for my Teams app

Azure Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor helps in tracking and monitoring app telemetry. It allows developers to instrument the app, track relevant metrics, custom business events in your Teams app across desktop, web or mobile clients.

While Azure Applications Insights does auto-instrumentation to automatically collect performance, error data and HTTP requests without code changes, most of the telemetry described in the previous section require capturing custom events. This requires Application Insights SDK to your application code.

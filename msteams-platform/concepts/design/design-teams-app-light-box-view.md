# Designing lightbox for your Microsoft Teams app

A lightbox is a content display that disables the page layout behind it to highlight important information. Lightboxes show uneditable, non-interactive content.

Lightbox view lets users glimpse media content â€” like images, videos, audio files, documents, PDFs in a large surface on top of the main Teams window. This component is primarily for viewing content at a glance:
Session time usually measured in seconds 
No desire to make changes to the file
Minimal in-file navigation (scrolling or timeline scrubbing)
Likely taking a quick look to reply to a conversation
Most common filetypes likely: image, short PDF or docs, short video clips

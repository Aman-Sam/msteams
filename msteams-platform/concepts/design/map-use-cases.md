# Map your use cases to Teams app features

A well-defined use case helps you to chart out the framework of features you want in the Teams app. After you've determined the user requirements, define the scope and Teams capability best suited for your app.

You can map your use case based on:

* Sharing and collaborating on items in an external system.
* Starting workflows and sending notifications to users.
* Using social platforms, conversational bots, and combining multiple features.

## Common use cases mapped to Teams capabilities

The next step is to match use cases with app capabilities.

Here's a list of common user scenarios mapped to Teams capabilities. It isn't an exhaustive list, but helps you think through some of the possibilities available to you.

## App capabilities mapped to features

The Microsoft Teams platform offers a large variety of features. Each feature is a way of interacting with your users that makes the Teams app capability relevant to the user need.

Let's look at how Teams capabilities enable different features for your app.

For example:

* Use the **tab** capability to display task modules, request device permissions, display <`iframe`> content, or using deep links.
* Use the **message extension** capability to send cards, unfurl links, or take action on messages.

# Cards Reference

The cards listed in this section are supported in Bots for Teams. These cards are based on cards defined by the bot framework, but Teams does not support all the cards provided by bot framework and has added additional cards.

# Card examples

You can find information on how to use cards in the documentation for the Bot Builder SDK. Code samples are in the Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples repository on GitHub.
* .NET
  * [Add rich card attachments to messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-add-rich-card-attachments)
  * [Rich cards sample code](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/CSharp/cards-RichCards)

## Common properties for all cards

### Inline card images

Your card can contain a inline image by including a link to the image content hosted on a public content-delivery network (CDN).

Images are scaled up or down in size while maintaining the aspect ratio to cover the image area, and then cropped from center to achieve the appropriate aspect ratio for the card.

Images must be at most 1024Ã—1024 and 1 MB in PNG, JPEG, or GIF format; animated GIF is not officially supported.

| Property | Type  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| url | URL | HTTPS URL to the image |
| alt | String | Accessible description of the image |

### Buttons

Buttons are shown stacked at the bottom of the card. Button text is always on a single line and will be truncated if the text exceeds the button width. Any additional buttons beyond the maximum number supported by the card will not be shown.

### Card actions

Most of the information you need about Connector cards is in [Using Office 365 Connector cards in Microsoft Teams](~/concepts/connectors#using-office-365-connector-cards-in-microsoft-teams), including details on actionable messages.

Office 365 Connector cards function properly on Microsoft Teams including [ActionCard actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/card-reference#actioncard-action)).

One important difference between using Connector cards from a Connector and using Connector cards in your bot is the handling of card actions

* For a Connector, the endpoint receives the card payload via HTTP POST.
* For a bot, the `HttpPOST` action triggers an `invoke` action that sends only the action ID and body to the bot.

To use Connector cards in your bot, we recommend using the `O365ConnectorCard` class in the [Teams extensions for the Bot Builder SDK](~/get-started/code#microsoft-teams-extensions-for-the-bot-builder-sdk) for .NET or Node.js. You can simplify handling of the `HttpPOST` action by using the `onO365ConnectorCardAction` method.

### Receipt Card

Not supported in Teams.
A card that enables a bot to provide a receipt to the user. It typically contains the list of items to include on the receipt, tax and total information, and other text.
`https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.receiptcard.html` 

### SignIn Card

A card that enables a bot to request that a user sign-in. It typically contains text and one or more buttons that the user can click to initiate the sign-in process.
`https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.signincard.html`

### Thumbnail Card

A card that typically contains a single thumbnail image, one or more buttons, and text.
`https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.thumbnailcard.html`

The [thumbnail card](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/attachments.html#thumbnailcard) renders a title, subtitle, text, small thumbmail image, and buttons.

![Example of a thumbnail card](~/assets/images/cards/thumbnail.png)

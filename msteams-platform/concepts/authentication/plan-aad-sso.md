# Authentication with AAD SSO

Single sign-on is an authentication method that lets users sign in using one set of credentials to access multiple independent software systems. Using SSO means a user doesn't have to sign in to every application they use. With SSO, users can access all needed applications without being required to authenticate using different credentials.

Many applications already exist in Azure AD that you can use with SSO. You have several options for SSO depending on the needs of the application and how it's implemented. Take time to plan your SSO deployment before you create applications in Azure AD. The management of applications can be made easier by using the My Apps portal.

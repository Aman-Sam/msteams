# Nested authentication

Nested authentication is a new authentication protocol for single page applications that are embedded in host environments like Teams, Outlook, and Harmony. It simplifies the authentication process and allows the app to request specific permissions for the resources it needs. It also aligns with the web authentication using Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) JS.

Nested App Authentication (NAA) facilitates single sign-on (SSO) across applications nested within supported first-party apps. It offers enhanced security and architectural agility over traditional authentication models and the on-behalf-of flow, enabling the development of dynamic, user-focused applications.

NAA endorses an "app-in-app" model, where a primary identity encompasses one or more app identities. Microsoft utilizes this framework in:

- Office Add-Ins
- Teams Tabs and Personal apps

In this structure, each app secures tokens from Microsoft Entra ID through their distinct app ID. The primary (Hub) app orchestrates communication and token management with Microsoft Entra ID for the nested (hosted) apps.


The following table outlines the difference between Teams Microsoft Entra ID SSO and Nested App Authentication:

| Steps | Traditional Teams Microsoft Entra ID SSO | Nested App Authentication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Expose redirect URI | ✔️ | ✔️ * SPA redirect URI necessary |
| Register API in Microsoft Entra ID | ✔️ |  |
| Define a custom scope in Microsoft Entra ID | ✔️ |  |
| Authorize Teams client apps | ✔️ |  |
| Revise Teams manifest | ✔️ | Recommended to help IT admins in providing consent via the Admin Portal |
| Acquire access token via Teams JS SDK | ✔️ |  |
| Acquire access token via MSAL.js |  | ✔️ * Requires new msalconfig property: supportsNestedAppAuth |
| Solicit user consent for more permissions | ✔️ |  |
| Conduct an OBO exchange on the server | ✔️ |  | 

To sum up, NAA is a potent and adaptable mechanism that bolsters the security and capabilities of your apps. By mastering the outlined procedures, you can harness this functionality to craft dynamic, user-oriented applications. For more information on NAA, see the official Microsoft documentation.

The existing authentication flow for embedded apps depends on the host environment and requires a middle tier service to do the on-behalf-of token exchange. The app also has to use the Teams JS SDK to get the token and consent to the host app's permissions.
The nested authentication flow is consistent across all host environments and doesn't require a middle tier service or the Teams JS SDK. The app only has to register its app in Microsoft Entra, configure a broker schema redirect URI, enable the native bridging in the manifest, and use MSAL JS to acquire the token and call the APIs. The app can also check the support status of nested authentication using the Teams JS SDK and provide a fallback experience for unsupported environments.

## Configure nested authentication

> [!NOTE]
> Nested authentication is in developer preview and not supported by all host environments. Developers need to check the support status using the Teams JS SDK and provide a fallback experience for unsupported environments.

To use nested authentication, follow these steps:

* Register their single page application in Microsoft Entra and configure the app registration with a broker schema redirect URI. This allows the host environments to broker the app.
* Enable the native bridging in the app manifest by setting the supportsNestedAppAuth property to true. This allows the app to communicate with the host environment.
* Initialize MSAL JS in the app and acquire the token using the new nested authentication flow. This prompts the user to consent to the app's permissions and return a token with the requested scopes.
* Use the token to call the Microsoft Graph or other APIs that the app needs.

• Migration: Developers who want to use nested app authentication need to register their single page application in Microsoft Entra and configure a broker schema redirect URI. They also need to enable the native bridging in the app manifest and initialize MSAL JS in the app. They can then acquire the token using the new nested app authentication flow and use it to call the Microsoft Graph or other APIs.
• Fallback: Developers need to check the support status of nested app authentication using the Teams JS SDK and provide a fallback experience for unsupported environments. For example, they can use the classic SSO or OBO flow for Teams mobile or Surface Hub.

### Register your single-page application

[Register your single-page application.](/entra/identity-platform/scenario-spa-app-registration)

### Add trusted brokers

Your application must actively configure one or more specialized redirect URIs to signal to the Microsoft identity platform that it's designed to be brokered by supported hosts, thereby enabling Nested App Auth. The redirect_uri of the application must be of type Single Page Application and conform to the following scheme:

```
brk-<broker_application_id>://<your_domain>
```

Where <broker_application_id> is the app ID or alias of the broker or brokers you wish to trust and <your_domain> is the fully qualified domain name where your application is hosted. For example, **brk-multihub://contoso.com**.

For your convenience, many broker groups are preconfigured in ESTS for common scenarios.

|Group Alias  |Constituent App IDs  |
|---------|---------|
|multihub Teams T1     | 5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346   |

### Enable native bridging

```javascript

// Config object to be passed to Msal on creation
const msalConfig = {
  auth: {
      clientId: "<your_app_id>",
      authority: "<https://login.microsoftonline.com/common>",
      supportsNestedAppAuth: true // Enable native bridging.
  }
};

// Create your library instance
PublicClientApplication.createPublicClientApplication(msalConfig)
    .then((result) => {
        // Start acquiring tokens
    });
```

### Acquire your first token

```javascript

// MSAL.js exposes several account APIs, logic to determine which account to use is the responsibility of the developer
const account = publicClientApplication.getActiveAccount();

const accessTokenRequest = {
  scopes: ["user.read"],
  account: account,
};

publicClientApplication
  .acquireTokenSilent(accessTokenRequest)
  .then(function (accessTokenResponse) {
    // Acquire token silent success
    let accessToken = accessTokenResponse.accessToken;
    // Call your API with token
    callApi(accessToken);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    //Acquire token silent failure, and send an interactive request
    if (error instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
      publicClientApplication
        .acquireTokenPopup(accessTokenRequest)
        .then(function (accessTokenResponse) {
          // Acquire token interactive success
          let accessToken = accessTokenResponse.accessToken;
          // Call your API with token
          callApi(accessToken);
        })
        .catch(function (error) {
          // Acquire token interactive failure
          console.log(error);
        });
    }
    console.log(error);
  });

```

If a user is required to interact with a Microsoft Entra ID consent dialog (acquireTokenPopup), then they're shown a speed bump dialog to ensure that user showed intent to open the Microsoft Entra ID window and to prevent the window from randomly appearing on the user's screen.

### Call an API

```javascript

var headers = new Headers();
var bearer = "Bearer " + access_token;
headers.append("Authorization", bearer);
var options = {
    method: "GET",
    headers: headers
};

var graphEndpoint = "<https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me>";

fetch(graphEndpoint, options)
    .then(function (response) {
        //do something with response
    });

```

### Best practices

* Use silent authentication whenever possible.
* MSAL.js provides the acquireTokenSilent method, which handles token renewal by making silent token requests without prompting the user. The method first looks for a valid cached token in the browser storage. If it doesn't find one, the library makes a silent request to Microsoft Entra and if there's an active user session (determined by a cookie set in browser on the Microsoft Entra domain), a fresh token is returned. The library doesn't automatically invoke the acquireTokenSilent method. We recommended that you call acquireTokenSilent in your app before making an API call to get the valid token.
* In certain cases, the acquireTokenSilent method's attempt to get the token fails. For example, when there's an expired user session with Microsoft Entra or a password change by the user, which requires user interaction. When the acquireTokenSilent fails, you need to call the interactive acquire token method (acquireTokenPopup).
* Have a fallback when NAA isn't supported.
* While we strive to provide a high-degree of compatibility with these flows across the Microsoft ecosystem, your application might appear in down-level/legacy clients aren't updated to support NAA. In these cases, your application doesn't support seamless SSO and you might need to invoke special APIs for interacting with the user to open authentication dialogs. For more info, see Authenticate and authorize with the Office dialog API.
* Test your application in multiple environments.
* If your application is expected to work in both WebView and browser deployments, we recommend testing your application in both of these deployment environments to ensure it behaves as you expect. Not all APIs supported in the browser work inside of WebViews.

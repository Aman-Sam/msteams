# Introducing Office 365 Connectors for Microsoft Teams

Office 365 Connectors are a great way to push your app's rich content into Microsoft Teams. Any user can connect a team to services like Trello, GitHub, Bing News, or Twitter and get notified of the team's activity in that service. From tracking a team's progress in Trello to following important hashtags in Twitter, Office 365 Connectors help your team to stay in sync and get more done.

You can even add actions to your content, turning them into *actionable messages*, so that users can complete tasks directly in the channel. (To learn more about actionable messages in general, see [Actionable messages in Outlook, Office 365 Groups, and Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/).)

>**New:** With Microsoft Teams apps, you can add your existing Office 365 Connector or build a new one to include in Microsoft Teams. See [Build your own Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/connectors-dev-dashboard#build-your-own-connector) for more information.

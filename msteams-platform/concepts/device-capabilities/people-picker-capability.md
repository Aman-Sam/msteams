# Integrate People Picker capability 

People Picker is a control to search and select people. This is a native capability available in Teams platform. You can integrate Teams native People Picker input control with your web apps. You can select between single or multi selection, and configurations, such as limiting search within a chat, channels, or across the entire organization.

You can use [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true), which provides `selectPeople` API to integrate the People Picker capability within your web app. 

## Advantages of integrating People Picker capability

* The People Picker control works in all of Teams surfaces, such as task module, a chat, channel, meeting tab, and personal app.
* This control allows you to search for and select users within a chat, channel, or the entire organization.
*  The People Picker capability helps with scenarios involving task assignment, tagging, notifying a user. 
* You can use this readily available control in your web app. It saves the effort and time significantly to build such a control on your own.

You must call the `selectPeople` API to integrate People Picker control in your Teams app. For effective integration, you must have an understanding of [code snippet](#code-snippet) for calling the API. 
It is important to familiarize yourself with the [API response errors](#error-handling) to handle the errors in your web app.

> [!NOTE] 
> Currently, Microsoft Teams support for People Picker capability is available for mobile clients only.

## `selectPeople` API 

`selectPeople` API enables you to add Teams native `People Picker input control` to your web apps.  
The API description is as follows:

| API      | Description  |
| --- | --- |
|**selectPeople**|Launches a People Picker and allows the user to search and select one or more people from the list.<br/><br/>This API returns the ID, name and email address of selected users to the calling web app.<br/><br/>In case of a personal app, the control searches across the organization. If the app is added to a chat or channel, then the search context is configured depending on the scenario. The search is restricted within the members of that chat, channel, or made available across the organization.|

The `selectPeople` API comes along with following input configurations:

|Configuration parameter|Type|Description| Default value|
|-----|------|--------------|------|
|`title`| String| It is an optional parameter. It sets title for the People Picker control. | Select people|
|`setSelected`|String| It is an optional parameter. You must pass AAD IDs of the people to be preselected. This parameter preselects people while launching the People Picker control. In case of single selection, only the first valid user is prepopulated ignoring the rest. |Null| 
|`openOrgWideSearchInChatOrChannel`|Boolean | It is an optional parameter. When it is set to true, it launches the People Picker in organization wide scope even if the app is added to a chat or channel. |False|
|`singleSelect`|Boolean|It is an optional parameter. When it is set to true, it launches the People Picker restricting the selection to one user only. |False|

### Code snippet

**Calling `selectPeople` API** to select people from a list:

```javascript
 microsoftTeams.people.selectPeople((error: microsoftTeams.SdkError, people: microsoftTeams.people.PeoplePickerResult[]) => 
 {
    if (error) 
    {
        if (error.message) 
           {
             alert(" ErrorCode: " + error.errorCode + error.message);
           }
            else 
            {
              alert(" ErrorCode: " + error.errorCode);
            }
      }
    if (people)
     {
            output(" People length: " + people.length + " " + JSON.stringify(people));
      }
  });
```

## Error handling

You must ensure to handle the errors appropriately in your web app. The following table lists the error codes and the conditions under which the errors are generated: 

|Error code |  Error name     | Condition|
| --------- | --------------- | -------- |
| **100** | NOT_SUPPORTED_ON_PLATFORM | API is not supported on the current platform.|
| **500** | INTERNAL_ERROR | Internal error is encountered while launching People Picker.|
| **4000** | INVALID_ARGUMENTS | API is invoked with wrong or insufficient mandatory arguments.|
| **8000** | USER_ABORT |User cancelled the operation.|
| **9000** | OLD_PLATFORM | User is on old platform build where implementation of the API is not present.  Upgrading the build resolves the issue.|

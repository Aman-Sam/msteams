# Execution of deep links

Applications can execute deep links from the following different contexts:

* Personal tab
* Shared tab
* Bot
* Chat message

## Personal or Shared tab

It's possible to navigate within an app using Teams JS. The following code demonstrates how to navigate to a specific entity within your Teams app. Apps can execute a deep link using the JS SDK. To execute a deep link, call the following API:

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

You can trigger navigation from your tab using the [pages.navigateToApp()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-navigatetoapp&preserve-view=true) function as shown in the following code:

```javascript
if (pages.isSupported()) {
  const navPromise = pages.navigateToApp({ appId: <appId>, pageId: <pageId>, webUrl: <webUrl>, subPageId: <subPageId>, channelId:<channelId>});
  navPromise.
     then((result) => {/*Successful navigation*/}).
     catch((error) => {/*Failed navigation*/});
}
else { /* handle case where capability isn't supported */ }
```

For more information about using the pages capability, see [pages.navigateToApp()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-navigatetoapp&preserve-view=true) and the [pages](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) namespace for other navigation options. If needed, it's also possible to directly open a deep link using the [app.openLink()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-app-openlink&preserve-view=true) function.

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

To trigger a deep link from your tab, call:

```javascript
microsoftTeams.executeDeepLink(/*deepLink*/);
```

Application can also use the SDK to execute certain scenarios without building a deep link themselves. Refer to each scenario for sample code.

## Chat message

Applications can post messages to a chat and add deep links to them. The following are different ways an application can include a deep link in a message

### Hyperlink text message

Applications can add a deep link as a hyper link markdown. The deep link will be executed within teams. Refer the code below:

`add sample`

### Raw link text message

Applications can include the raw link in a message. The deep link will execute within teams. Refer the code below:

`add sample`

### Adaptive Card â€“ Open URL Action  

Applications can include an `open URL` action in an adaptive card and add a deep link to it. The deep link will execute with-in Teams. Refer to the sample adaptive card payload below:

`add sample`

### Adaptive Card as hyperlink Markdown (Not recommended)

Applications can include a hyperlink markdown in an adaptive card. This opens in browser first**. Refer to sample payload below:

`add sample`

**Have seen varying results depending on where the link is executed

### Adaptive Card as raw link (Not recommended)

Raw link in adaptive card body doesn't have any action associated.

## Bot

### Open URL action in bot

Applications can include an `open URL` action in a bot and add a deep link to it. The deep link will execute with-in Teams. Refer to the sample adaptive card payload below:

`add sample`

### Card body of the bot

Applications can include the raw link in a Card body. The deep link opens in a browser first. Refer the code below:

`add sample`

#### Hyperlink markdown in a Bot

Applications can include a hyperlink markdown in a Bot. This opens in browser first**. Refer to sample payload below:

`add sample`

## Handling deep links

When a deep link to an application tab is executed, applications should make sure they respect all the parameters set in that link on tab context. Applications should read the tab context to identify the page, sub page, or label referred to in the deep link and should navigate to the specific section.

# Developer Portal for Teams

The <a href="https://dev.teams.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Developer Portal for Teams</a> is the primary tool for configuring, distributing, and managing your Microsoft Teams apps. With the Developer Portal, you can collaborate with colleagues on your app, set up runtime environments, and much more.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Currently, Developer Portal is not available for Government Community Cloud (GCC)-High or Department of Defense (DOD) tenants.
> * However, you can use a regular tenant to build an app in the Developer Portal, download the app, and upload the app using [Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/teamsapp-publish?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true) to a national cloud. For more information, see [National cloud deployments](/graph/deployments).

## Register an app

The Developer Portal provides the following ways to register a Teams app:

* [Create and register a brand new app](#create-and-register-a-brand-new-app).
* [Import an existing app package](#import-an-existing-app).

### Create and register a brand new app

The Developer portal allows you to create a brand new app:

1. Log into [Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com), select **Apps** from the left pane.

1. In the Developer Portal, select **Apps** from the left pane.
1. Select **Import App**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tdp/import-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to import your existing app in Developer Portal for Teams.":::

1. Select the app manifest file, and then select **Open**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If there are nested folders or missing required files in the app package folder, you receive an error message as **Provided add-in package was not understood. Please, make sure that the file being submitted is a valid Office add-in package**.

1. Select **Import**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * The Developer Portal creates a unique app ID and locks the ID for your registered Teams app. You canâ€™t edit or provide an ID of your choice, which prevents to have duplicate app IDs for multiple apps.
> * If you create an app using the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, you can manage your app in the Developer Portal. For more information, see [Build apps with teams toolkit and Visual studio code](~/toolkit/visual-studio-code-overview.md).
> * You can import an existing app which you created on App Studio to the Developer Portal. To import an already published app to Developer Portal, the [app owner](~/concepts/build-and-test/manage-your-apps-in-developer-portal.md#advanced) needs to raise a service request through [admin portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/support) to transfer the ownership over the app ID.

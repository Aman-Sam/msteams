# Developer Portal for Teams

<a href="https://dev.teams.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Developer Portal for Teams</a> is the primary tool for configuring, distributing, and managing your Microsoft Teams apps. With Developer Portal, you can collaborate with colleagues on your app, set up runtime environments, and much more.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Currently, Developer Portal is not available for Government Community Cloud (GCC)-High or Department of Defense (DOD) tenants.
> * However, you can use a regular tenant to build an app in Developer Portal, download the app, and upload the app using [Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/teamsapp-publish?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true) to a national cloud. For more information, see [National cloud deployments](/graph/deployments).

## Register an app

Developer Portal provides the following ways to register a Teams app:

* [Create and register a brand new app](#create-and-register-a-brand-new-app).
* [Import an existing app package](#import-an-existing-app).

### Create and register a brand new app

Developer portal allows you to create a brand new app:

1. Log into Developer Portal, select **Apps** from the left pane.

Now you've successfully created a brand new app and you can see all the basic information of the new app.

### Import an existing app

Follow the steps to import and manage your existing app in Developer Portal:

1. Select **Apps** from the left pane of the Developer Portal.
1. Select **Import App**.

1. Select the app manifest file, and then select **Open**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can receive an error message such as **Provided add-in package was not understood. Ensure that the file being submitted is a valid Office add-in package**, if there are nested folders or missing files in the app package folder.

1. Select **Import**.

   * Developer Portal creates a unique app ID and locks the ID for your registered Teams app. You canâ€™t edit or provide an ID of your choice, which prevents to have duplicate app IDs for multiple apps.
   * If you create an app using the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, you can manage your app in Developer Portal.
   * You can import an existing app which you created on App Studio to Developer Portal. To import an already published app to Developer Portal, the [app owner](~/concepts/build-and-test/manage-your-apps-in-developer-portal.md#advanced) needs to raise a service request through [admin portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/support) to transfer the ownership over the app ID.

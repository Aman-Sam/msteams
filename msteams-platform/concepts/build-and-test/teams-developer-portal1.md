> * However, you can use a regular tenant to build an app in the Developer Portal, download the app, and upload the app using [Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/teamsapp-publish?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true) to a national cloud. For more information, see [National cloud deployments](/graph/deployments).

> [!NOTE]
>
> * The Developer Portal creates a unique app ID and locks the ID for your registered Teams app. You canâ€™t edit or provide an ID of your choice, which prevents to have duplicate app IDs for multiple apps.
> * If you create an app using the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, you can manage your app in the Developer Portal. For more information, see [Build apps with teams toolkit and Visual studio code](~/toolkit/visual-studio-code-overview.md).
> * You can import an existing app which you created on App Studio to the Developer Portal.

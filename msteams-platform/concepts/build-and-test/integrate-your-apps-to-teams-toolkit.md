# Integrate with Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio

After you create your app in Teams Developer Portal, you can:

* [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code and in](#open-your-app-in-visual-studio-code)
* [Open your app in Visual Studio](#open-your-app-in-visual-studio)

## Open your app in Visual Studio Code

In Teams Developer Portal, you can now directly open in Visual Studio Code and launch your project in Visual Studio Code. Furthermore, Teams Toolkit will scaffold the necessary files based on the features and configurations you set in Teams Developer Portal, so there is seamless transition and all the context needed to start coding in detail.

Following are the steps to open your app in Visual Studio Code:

1. Go to **Develop (Preview)** > **Open in Teams Toolkit (JS/TS)** to open Visual Studio Code and scaffold your app.
1. Select "Open Link"
1. Select "Open". Log in to your correct M365 account if prompt (the same account you use to log in to Teams Developer Portal)
1. Select your preferred programming language.
1. Select your workspace folder.
1. Enter your application name.
1. Select your URL and hit "OK". Teams Toolkit will convert the URL you configured in Teams Developer Portal to a localhost address to work with the debugging process.
1. Teams Toolkit would then scaffold your project, you now are ready to start development.

## Open your app in Visual Studio

You could open your project in Visual Studio directly, note it requires Visual Studio 2022 17.6 Preview 2 installed (you can download it here). To scaffold you project in Visual Studio with Teams Toolkit, open your app in Teams Developer Portal and navigate to "Develop (Preview)" -> "Open in Teams Toolkit". Click on the “Open in Visual Studio (.NET)” button to scaffold your project.

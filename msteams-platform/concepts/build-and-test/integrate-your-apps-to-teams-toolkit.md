# Integrate Developer Portal with Teams Toolkit

After you create your app in Teams Developer Portal, you can:

* [Open your app in Visual Studio Code](#open-your-app-in-visual-studio-code)
* [Open your app in Visual Studio](#open-your-app-in-visual-studio)

Teams Toolkit scaffolds the necessary files based on the feature and configurations you set in Teams Developer Portal. This makes a seamless transition between Teams Developer Portal and Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio.

Following are the steps to open your app in Visual Studio Code:

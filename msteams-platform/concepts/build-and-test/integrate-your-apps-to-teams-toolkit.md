# Integrate with Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio

After you create your app in Teams Developer Portal, you can:

* [Open your app in Visual Studio Code](#open-your-app-in-visual-studio-code)
* [Open your app in Visual Studio](#open-your-app-in-visual-studio)

## Open your app in Visual Studio Code

In Teams Developer Portal, you can now directly open in Visual Studio Code and launch your project in Visual Studio Code. Teams Toolkit scaffolds the necessary files based on the feature and configurations you set in Teams Developer Portal, so there's seamless transition and all the context needed to start coding in detail.

Following are the steps to open your app in Visual Studio Code:

1. Select **Develop (Preview)** > **Open in Teams Toolkit (JS/TS)** to open Visual Studio Code and scaffold your app.

## Teams toolkit

Teams Toolkit makes it simple to get started with app development for Microsoft Teams. You can start a project template for common line-of-business app scenarios or from a sample and save setup time with automated app registration and configuration. You can debug to Teams directly from familiar tools. Teams toolkit's smart defaults help you host in Azure using infrastructure-as-code and Bicep. It helps you to create unique configurations using the environment features such as, dev, test, and prod.

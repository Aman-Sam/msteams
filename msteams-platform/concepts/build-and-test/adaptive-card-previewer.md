# Microsoft Adaptive Card Previewer

The Microsoft Adaptive Card Previewer allows you easily preview the Adaptive Cards when you are iterating over your card designs. It uses the latest rendering stack for Microsoft Teams to provide a more accurate preview of Adaptive Cards. You can open a side-by-side preview to view changes live, toggle between light, dark, and high contrast themes.

## Features of Adaptive Card Previewer

The primary goal of Adaptive Card Previewer is to provide developers with a faster and more reliable solution for previewing adaptive card designs. It supports:

* Instant preview of adaptive cards in VS Code editor through CodeLens or Command Palette.

* Switch between different themes (Light/Dark/HighContrast) to preview your cards so you can design with confidence.

* Separation of data from the layout in an Adaptive Card template language. Use command Adaptive Card: New Data File to add a data file for a template. This will generate an empty file where you can bind data to your adaptive card template.

* Seamless integration with Teams Toolkit that allows a Just-In-Time installation of Adaptive Card Previewer when you are iterating on adaptive cards generated from Teams Toolkit project creation.

* Configure default theme through Visual Studio Code extension settings adaptiveCardPreviewer.defaultTheme.

# Microsoft Teams developer self-assessment program

//be more introductory

As part of the [app submission process](~/platform/publishing/apps-publish.md) you'll have the option to complete a voluntary self-assessment covering your app security, data handling and compliance practices. The information you provide will be processed and presented to your potential customers so that they may better evaluate your app before enabling it for their organization. App developers that complete the assessment will receive a badge that will be displayed alongside your app in the app store, making easy for customers to identify apps that will be significantly simpler for their organization to evaluate and enable.

## Program benefits

// remove badge, split second benefit

Once you've completed the assessment your app will receive the following benefits:

* A badge prominently displayed on your app in the app store, making it easy for potential customers to identify your app. The badge will also be displayed in the [administrative portal](/microsoftteams/admin-settings) when IT admins are setting app policies.

* You responses will be compiled and a page for your app will be created on [this site](/otherplace). You'll be able to point your customers to this page for complete information on your app, instead of responding to requests for information individually.

## How to join the program

Joining the self-assessment program is voluntary, but highly encouraged. Just let us know you're interested and we'll guide you through the process.

### For existing store apps

If you already have an app in the app store and you'd like to join the program you can contact us by filling out [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR3oKPRKv815GlRdzCCYPJGZUOUgzSUtFNU8yOFpYR0oyWElHVkxHODhQUyQlQCN0PWcu) to let us know that you're interested. Someone from our team will follow up with you to get the process started.

### For new or updated store apps

For newly submitted apps, or update submissions to existing apps, you'll be asked to participate during the approval process. While this is not required, and will not block the approval of your app, we highly suggest that you take the time to fill out the self-assessment.

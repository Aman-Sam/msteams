# Microsoft Teams apps self-assessment program

This program aims to streamline the process of gathering and reviewing 3rd party app information related to its security, data handling and compliance practices. As part of the app submission process you'll have the option to complete a voluntary self-assessment. The information you provide will be processed and presented to your potential customers so that they may better evaluate your app before enabling it for their organization. App developers that complete the assessment will receive a badge that will be displayed alongside your app in the app store, making it easier for customers to identify apps that will be significantly easier for their organization to evaluate and enable.

## why should you care?

## what do I need to do?

## what is the expected outcome?

## what should I do next?

We are looking to gather this information from our partners and make it available in one central location, in a consistent format for all our 3rd party app integrations. 
This will help our enterprise customers expedite the otherwise arduous and long process of reviewing apps before approving them for use in their tenant. The self-assessment report coming directly from the partner helps build trust in the validity of the information. 
We believe the program will also help our partners minimize their efforts with filling out disparate RFPs by providing security and compliance related information once and having it be available for all enterprises. Partners who provide a self-assessment report will earn a badge that will be displayed in the Teams apps details page in appsource.microsoft.com and in the IT Admin portal experience.

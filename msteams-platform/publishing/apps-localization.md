# Localization for Microsoft Teams apps

When localizing your Microsoft Teams app there are three major areas you need to consider.

1. Your AppSource listing (if you're deploying to the app store)
1. The language strings in your app manifest
1. Responding to localized text submitted from your users.

## Localizing your AppSource listing

If you're publishing to the app store, you need to be aware that localizing your AppSource listing is not yet supported. In preparation for support for localized listings in the app store you can still add additional languages to your listing. The information you provide in [Seller Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248605) for your listing will appear only in the [AppSource website](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=office%3Bteams&page=1).

## Recommendations for non-English and mixed-language apps until localization is implemented

In [Seller Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248605), select both English and the actual language of the app (even if the app is not available in English). French is used in this example.

### Add English language

* Fill in the app name.
* Fill in a short description of the app in English.
* Fill in the long description of the app in English.
* In the long description, please also add the line “This app is in “French”.
* Upload the images of your app UI. The screenshots will show the actual language (in this example, French).

### Add French language

* Fill in the app name.
* Fill in a short description of the app in French.
* Fill in the Long description of the app in French.
* Upload the images of your app UI.

The images for both English and French languages will be the same.

See the [Localized content](~/publishing/office-store-checklist#localized-content) section of the AppSource checklist for more information on these fields.

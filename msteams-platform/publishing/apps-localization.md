# Localization for Teams apps

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams plans to support localized content in the future. Currently, only English is supported for Teams apps. You can still publish an app in another language using the following steps.

## Recommendations for Non-English and Mixed language apps for short term until Localization is implemented

Please select the Seller dashboard language as both English and the actual Language of the app. French is used in this example.

### Add English language

* Fill in the app name
* Fill in a short description of the app in English.
* Fill in the long description of the app in English.
* In the long description, please also add the line “This app is in “French”.
* Upload the images of your app UI. The screenshots will show the actual language.

### Add French language

* Fill in the app name.
* Fill in a short description of the app in French.
* Fill in the Long description of the app in French.
* Upload the images of your app UI.

The images for both English and French languages will be the same.

See the [Localized content](~/publishing/office-store-checklist#localized-content) section of the AppSource checklist for more information on these fields.

# Localization for Microsoft Teams apps

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams plans to allow apps to support multiple languages. Currently, only English is officially supported for Teams apps that appear in the Teams Store and [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com). However, you can still publish an app in another language using the following steps.

## Recommendations for non-English and mixed-language apps until localization is implemented

In [Seller Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248605), select both English and the actual language of the app (even if the app is not available in English). French is used in this example.

### Add English language

* Fill in the app name
* Fill in a short description of the app in English.
* Fill in the long description of the app in English.
* In the long description, please also add the line “This app is in “French”.
* Upload the images of your app UI. The screenshots will show the actual language (in this example, French).

### Add French language

* Fill in the app name.
* Fill in a short description of the app in French.
* Fill in the Long description of the app in French.
* Upload the images of your app UI.

The images for both English and French languages will be the same.

See the [Localized content](~/publishing/office-store-checklist#localized-content) section of the AppSource checklist for more information on these fields.

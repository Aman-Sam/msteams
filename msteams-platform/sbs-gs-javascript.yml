    Start Microsoft Teams app development with your first Teams app.
    You'll create three Teams apps: a tab app, a bot app, and a message extension app.

    Each of your app will have a capability, which comes with its own UI and UX:
    
    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/your-helloworld-app.png" alt-text="Diagram showing this app has three features." border="false":::
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > In this tutorial, you'll create a tab app first, followed by a bot app, and then a message extension app. However, you can select to build an app with any capability first, without hindering the functionality of other apps.

    In this tutorial, you'll learn:

    - How to set up a new project with Teams Toolkit.
    - How to build three apps with a different capability each—tab, bot, and message extension.
    - The structure of the app:
        - The tab portion with JavaScript using React.
        - The rest of the features with Node.js.
    - How to deploy your app

   ## Prepare development environment

   After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.


   ### Install the Teams Toolkit

   The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    
   You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code, or CLI (command-line interface), called `TeamsFx`.


   # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

   1. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
   1. In the search box, enter **Teams Toolkit**.
   1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/install-toolkit-vscode.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit extension installation." border="false":::

    The Teams Toolkit icon appears in the Visual Studio Code sidebar after it's installed.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/hw-teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code sidebar." border="false":::

   You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

   # [Command line](#tab/cli)

   To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

   ``` bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

   ``` bash
   sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

   Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

   You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the "remote signed" execution policy for PowerShell.

   ---

   ## Set up your Teams development tenant

   A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where your sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

   ### Check for sideloading option

   After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you will not be able to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

   Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

   Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select the **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Publish an app**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you don't have the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

   ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

   If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

   1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
   1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
   1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
   1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Microsoft" border="true":::

   1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

   ## Get a free Azure account

   If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

   Now you’ve got all tools and set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building! Select the app you want to do first.

- title: Create project workspace for your tab app
  durationInMinutes: 1

    ## Take a tour of the tab app source code

    Teams Toolkit provides all components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the **Explorer** area of Visual Studio Code.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-tab/hw-folder-structure-tab12.png" alt-text="structure tab" border="true":::


    Although you're free to choose any UI framework (or not to use any), this sample template code provides a scaffolding with React components.

    Among other items in this directory structure, the Toolkit maintains:

    | Folder name | Contents |
    | --- | --- |
    | `.fx/configs` | Configuration files that user can customize for the Teams app. |
    | - `.fx/configs/config.<envName>.json` | Configuration file for every environment. |
    | - `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.<envName>.json` | Parameters file for Azure BICEP provision for every environment. |
    | - `.fx/configs/projectSettings.json` | Global project settings that apply to all environments. |
    | - `.fx/states` | Provision output that is generated by Teams Toolkit.  The toolkit creates this folder after you provision resources for your app. |
    | - `.fx/states/state.<envName>.json` | Provision output file for every environment. |
    | - `.fx/states/<env>.userdata` | Sensitive user data for the provision output for every environment. |
    | `tabs` | Code for the Tab capability needed at runtime, such as the privacy notice, terms of use, and configuration tabs. |
    | - `tabs/src/index.jsx` | Entry point for the front-end app, where the main App component is rendered with `ReactDOM.render()` |
    | - `tabs/src/components/App.jsx` | Code for handling URL routing in the app. It calls the [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](../msteams-platform/tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-sdk.md) to establish communication between your app and Teams. |
    | - `tabs/src/components/Tab.jsx` | Code to implement the UI of your app. |
    | - `tabs/src/components/TabConfig.jsx` | Code to implement the UI that configures your app. |
    | `templates/appPackage` | App manifest template files, and the app icons: color.png and outline.png. |
    | - `templates/appPackage/manifest.template.json` | App manifest for running the app in local or remote environment.  |
    | `templates/azure` | BICEP template files |

    When you add the cloud functionality, Teams Toolkit adds the necessary folders to the project. The `api` folder holds the code to any Azure Functions you write.

      You know how to use Toolkit to set up a tab app and run it locally. Next, let’s learn how to build a conversational chat bot with Toolkit!

- title: Create project workspace for your bot app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    You've built your tab app. Now let's create your first bot app.
    
    The bot capability of a Teams app creates a chatbot or a conversational bot. You use it to run simple and automated tasks, like providing customer service. A bot talks with a web service and helps you use its offerings. You can get weather forecast, make reservations, or any other service offered using a conversational bot.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-bot/your-helloworld-app-bot.png" alt-text="Diagram showing this app has three features. Bot is highlighted." border="false":::
    
    As you've already prepared for creating these apps, you can set up a new Teams project for creating the bot app.

    In this tutorial, you'll learn:

- title: Create project workspace for your message extension app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    You've built your bot app. Now, let's create your first message extension app.

    Message Extension capability lets you interact with a web service. Use the compose area, command box, or a messaging in Teams client to search and initiate actions in an external system.

      :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/your-helloworld-app-msgext.png" alt-text="Diagram showing this app has three features. message extension is highlighted." border="false":::

    There are two types of Teams **message extensions**:

    - [Search commands](../msteams-platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command.md): You can search external systems. Then, you can insert its results into a message in the form of a card.
    - [Action commands](../msteams-platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/define-action-command.md): You can present your users with a modal popup to collect or display information. Then, you can process their interaction and send information back to Teams.

    Let's create a message extension app with a *search command*. Use it to search for external data and insert the results into a message within Teams client.

    As you've already prepared for creating these apps, you can set up a new Teams project for creating the message extension app.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Message extensions rely on bots to provide a dialog between the user and your code.


    In this tutorial, you'll learn:

    You've learned to create, build, and run Teams app with Tab, Bot, and Message Extension capabilities. The final step is to deploy your app on Azure.

    Let's deploy the first app with Tab capability on Azure using Teams Toolkit.

    ## Sign in to your Azure account

    Use this account to access the Microsoft Azure portal and to provision new cloud resources to support your app.

    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/viscode)

    1. Open Visual Studio Code.
    1. Open the project folder in which you created the tab app.
    1. Select the Teams Toolkit  :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon in the sidebar.
    1. Select **Sign in to Azure**.

        > [!TIP]
        > If you have the Azure Account extension installed and are using the same account, you can skip this step. Use the same account as you are using in other extensions.

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account.
    1. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials.
    1. Close the browser when prompted and return to Visual Studio Code.

        The **ACCOUNTS** section of the sidebar shows the two accounts separately. It also lists the number of usable Azure subscriptions available to you. Ensure you have at least one usable Azure subscription available. If not, sign out and use a different account.

        Now you're ready to deploy your app to Azure!

        Congratulations, you have created three types of Teams apps! 
        Now let's go ahead and learn how to deploy one of the apps to Azure using the Teams Toolkit.

    # [Command line](#tab/cline)

    1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 with the TeamsFx CLI:

        ``` bash
        teamsfx account login m365
        ```

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials. Close the browser when you're prompted.

    2. Sign in to Azure with the TeamsFx CLI:

        ``` bash
        teamsfx account login azure
        ```

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials. Close the browser when you're prompted.

        The account logins are shared between Visual Studio Code and the TeamsFx CLI.

        Congratulations, you have created three types of Teams apps! 
        Now let's go ahead and learn how to deploy one of the apps to Azure using the Teams Toolkit.

      <summary>Learn what happens when you deployed your app to Azure</summary>

      Before deployment, the application has been running locally:

      * The backend runs using **Azure Functions Core Tools**.
      * The application HTTP endpoint, where Microsoft Teams loads the application, runs locally.

      Deployment is a two-step process. You provision the resources on an active Azure subscription, and then deploy or upload the backend and frontend code for the application to Azure.

      * The backend, if configured, uses various Azure services, including Azure App Service and Azure Storage.
      * The frontend application will be deployed to an Azure Storage account configured for static web hosting.

    You've done it!

    You've created three apps, each with a different capability: a tab app, a bot app, and a message extension app.

    Now that you've learned to create basic apps, you can move on to creating more complex apps. To start with, try adding capabilities to your existing apps.

    To add capabilities to your existing app:

    1. Select **Add capability** from the **Development** section of the Teams Toolkit sidebar.

    1. Select the capability you want to add to your app.

    That's it! Teams Toolkit adds the scaffolding for the new capability to your app's directory structure. Follow the procedures to build and deploy the app, and your app will have multiple capabilities. 

    You've completed the tutorial to build apps with JavaScript.

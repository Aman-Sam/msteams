    Message extensions using API significantly enhance the functionality of your Teams apps by allowing them to interact with external services. This can help streamline workflows by reducing the need to switch between different applications.

    You can use API message extension to integrate external services that are commonly used in the business workflow. For example, a business that frequently uses a CRM system for customer management could use a Messaging Extension to fetch and display customer data directly from Teams. This can help save time and improve efficiency by reducing the need to switch between different applications. This feature is supported on all platforms where Teams is available, including desktop, web, and mobile.

   Here's a list of tools you need for building and deploying your apps.

   | Install | For using... |
   | --- | --- |
   |[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, or call - all in one place.|
   |[Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |
   |[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. Use version 1.55 or later. |
   |[Microsoft 365 developer account](concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md)| Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
   |[Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) | Access to Azure resources.|
   
   ## Set up your Teams development tenant

   A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where your sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

   ### Check for sideloading option

   After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you can't preview and test your app in Teams local environment.

   Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

   Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select the **Apps** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Upload an app**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Contact your Teams administrator, if you don't find the option to upload a custom app.

   ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

   If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

   1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
   1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
   1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
   1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Microsoft 365 Developer Program.":::

   1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

   ## Get a free Azure account

   If you want to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

   Now you’ve got all the tools to set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building! Select the app you want to build first.


- title: Create OpenAPI specification document
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |

    ## OpenAPI specification
  
    OpenAPI specification (OAS) is the industry-standard specification that outlines how OpenAPI files are structured and outlined. It's a language-agnostic, human-readable format for describing APIs. It's easy for both humans and machines to read and write. The schema is machine-readable and represented in either YAML or JSON.
    
    You need an OpenAPI specification to interact with the APIs. The API spec must meet the following criteria: 
    
    * Must not have `auth` specified.
    * Must have at most one required parameter or property in the request body. You can make a required parameter optional and add a default value.
    * The request body (if present) can't contain any arrays.
    * The server URL must be defined in the specification.
    * If there's no operation ID, you can add one to the spec that you'll be uploading for testing because an operation ID is mandatory for operations that'll be Messaging Extensions. You can validate that the swagger is valid by using an online validator like [Swagger Parser](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/). Once you have found a suitable API spec, save it in a folder. 

    We've used the following OpenAPI spec as an example for this tutorial:

- title: Create response rendering template
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |

   An OpenAPI specification document requires a response rendering template for the app to respond to the get requests. The response rendering template consists of an Adaptive Card template, Preview card template, and metadata.

   ### Adaptive Card template 
    
    
    To create an  Adaptive Card template, follow these steps:
    
    1. Go to ChatGPT and ask the following query in the message compose area:

       ```text
        Create an Adaptive Card template that binds to the following sample data:
        {
            "name": "Nike Dunk Low W - White/Black",
            "url": "https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/pl/cl337/3200134705/Shoes/Nike-Dunk-Low-W-White-Black/?utm_source=openai&ref-site=openai_plugin",
            "price": "$53.00",
            "attributes": [
                "Outsole:Rubber",
                "Fastening:Laced",
                "Target Group:Female",
                "Color:Black",
                "Upper Material:Leather",
                "Size (US):9.5,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11.5,10.5,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,2.5,3.5,4.5,16.5,5.5,15.5,6.5,14.5,13.5,7.5,8.5,12.5",
                "Series:Nike Dunk"
            ]
            }
       ```
     1. Select **Send message**. 

     1. ChatGPT generates a response with an Adaptive Card template that binds to the sample data. Save the Adaptive Card template for future reference.

        Following is an example of the Adaptive Card template:

        <details><summary>Adaptive Card template</summary>

        ```json
        {
        "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "version": "1.4",
        "body": [
            {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Product Details",
            "weight": "Bolder",
            "size": "Large"
            },
            {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "${name}",
            "weight": "Bolder",
            "size": "Medium"
            },
            {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "${price}",
            "size": "Medium",
            "spacing": "None"
            },
            {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Attributes:",
            "weight": "Bolder",
            "spacing": "Medium"
            },
            {
            "type": "FactSet",
            "facts": [
                {
                "title": "Outsole",
                "value": "${attributes[0]}"
                },
                {
                "title": "Fastening",
                "value": "${attributes[1]}"
                },
                {
                "title": "Target Group",
                "value": "${attributes[2]}"
                },
                {
                "title": "Color",
                "value": "${attributes[3]}"
                },
                {
                "title": "Upper Material",
                "value": "${attributes[4]}"
                },
                {
                "title": "Size (US)",
                "value": "${attributes[5]}"
                },
                {
                "title": "Series",
                "value": "${attributes[6]}"
                }
            ],
            "spacing": "Small"
            },
            {
            "type": "ActionSet",
            "actions": [
                {
                "type": "OpenUrl",
                "title": "View Product",
                "url": "${url}"
                }
            ]
            }
        ]
        }
        ``` 
        </details>

    1. You can verify if the Adaptive Card generated binds to the sample data by following these steps:
       1. Go to [Adaptive Card Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/).
       1. In the left pane, under **CARD PAYLOAD EDITOR**, paste the Adaptive Card template code.
       1. In the right pane, under **SAMPLE DATA EDITOR**, paste the product response you've saved earlier.
       1. Select **Update**.
       1. Verify if the Adaptive Card template binds to the sample data.

          :::image type="content" source="assets/images/Copilot/api-me-sbs-adaptive-card-designer.png" alt-text="Screenshots shows the Adaptive Card designer with the Adaptive Card template and the sample data."::: 
       
       1. Select **Preview mode**. The Adaptive Card designer displays an Adaptive Card with the data that binds to the sample data.
          
          :::image type="content" source="assets/images/Copilot/api-me-sbs-adaptive-card-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshots shows the Adaptive Card designer with the Adaptive Card template and the sample data.":::   
    
    1. Create a preview card template. The preview card template can contain a `title`, `subtitle` and `image` properties. If the API response doesn't have an image, you can remove the image property.

       Following is an example of a preview card template:

       <details><summary>Preview card template</summary>

       ```json
       {
        "title": "Title: ${if(title, title, 'N/A')}",
        "subtitle": "Description: ${if(description, description, 'N/A')}",
        "image": {
            "url": "${image}",
            "$when": "${image != null}"
        }
       }
       ```
       Create an if condition for the `title` and `subtitle` where, if name exists, the bot uses the name, else, it uses NA. For example, `"title": "Name: ${if(name, name, 'N/A')}"`. Save the preview card template for future reference.
       </details>


     ### Response rendering template

    To create a response rendering template, follow these steps:

    1. Create a json file and create a response rendering template that conforms to the following schema:

       ```json
       { 
         "version": "1.0.0", 
         "$schema": "<URL_REFERENCE_TO_SCHEMA>", 
         "jsonPath": "", 
         "responseLayout": "", 
         "responseCardTemplate": { 
        },
        "previewCardTemplate": {
            }
        }
        ```
    1. Update the properties in the response rendering template as follows:
       1. `"version"`: `"1.0.0"`
       1. `"$schema"`: `"http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json"`
       1. `"jsonPath"`: `"products"`

          `jsonPath` is the path to the result(s) in the response JSON response. Add the `jsonPath` to the relevant data/array from the product list in the API response. In this case, the `jsonPath` is "products". For more information on how to determiner the JSON path, see [Querying JSON with JSON path](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/QueryJsonSelectToken.htm).

       1. `"responseLayout"`: `"list"`

           `responseLayout` specifies the layout of the attachments. Used for responses of type result. Supported types are list and grid. If the response body contains an object with multiple elements like text, title, and image, then the response layout must be set to `list`. If the API response contains only images or thumbnails, then the response layout must be set to `grid`.

       1. `"responseCardTemplate"`: Paste the Adaptive Card template code you've saved earlier.

           `responseCardTemplate` is an adaptive card template to map the JSON response to an adaptive card.

       1. `"previewCardTemplate"`: Paste the preview card template code you've saved earlier.

           `previewCardTemplate` is a preview card template is used to show a preview of results in the message extension flyout.

    1. Save the response rendering template in the same folder you saved the OpenAPI spec. 

    The following code is an example of a Response rendering template:

    <details><summary>Response rendering template</summary>
    
    ```json
    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "responseLayout": "list",
        "responseCardTemplate": {
        "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "version": "1.4",
        "body": [

            "size": "Large"
            },
            {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "${name}",
            "weight": "Bolder",
            "size": "Medium"
            },
            {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "${price}",
            "size": "Medium",
            "spacing": "None"
            },
            {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Attributes:",
            "weight": "Bolder",
            "spacing": "Medium"
            },
            {

            "facts": [
                {
                "title": "Outsole",
                "value": "${attributes[0]}"
                },
                {

                "value": "${attributes[2]}"
                },
                {
                "title": "Color",
                "value": "${attributes[3]}"
                },
                {
                "title": "Upper Material",
                "value": "${attributes[4]}"
                },
                {
                "title": "Size (US)",
                "value": "${attributes[5]}"

- title: Create app manifest
  durationInMinutes: 3
  content: |

    Now, you need to create an app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest). The app manifest describes how your app integrates into the Microsoft Teams product.

    ### Create a Teams app manifest
    
    To create the manifest, follow these steps: 
    
    1. Create a new JSON file. Your app manifest must conform to the schema defined in the [Microsoft Teams schema](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.16/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json).

    1. Add the following code in the JSON file:

       <details><summary>App manifest</summary>

       ```json
       {
        "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.14/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
        "manifestVersion": "devPreview",
        "version": "1.0.3",
        "id": "<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>",
        "packageName": "com.microsoft.teams.extension",
        "developer": {
            "name": "Teams App, Inc.",
            "websiteUrl": "https://www.example.com",
            "privacyUrl": "https://www.example.com/termofuse",
            "termsOfUseUrl": "https://www.example.com/privacy"
        },
        "icons": {
            "color": "color.png",
            "outline": "outline.png"
        },
        "name": {
            "short": "Search ME API",
            "full": "Search ME API full"
        },
        "description": {
            "short": "product app for testing API MEs",
            "full": "product app for testing API MEs"
        },
        "accentColor": "#FFFFFF",
        "composeExtensions": [
            {
                "composeExtensionType": "",
                "apiSpecificationFile": "",
                "commands": [
                    {
                        "context": [
                            "compose"
                        ],
                        "type": "query",
                        "title": "API for fetching Klarna.",
                        "id": "",
                        "parameters": [
                            {
                                "name": "",
                                "title": "",
                                "description": ""
                            }
                        ],
                        "description": "",
                        "apiResponseRenderingTemplateFile": ""
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "permissions": [
            "identity",
            "messageTeamMembers"
        ],
        "validDomains": []
       }
       ```
       </details>
    
    1. Update the app manifest properties as follows:

         * Replace `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>`  with bot's Microsoft App ID.
         * Update the values for `composeExtensionType` to `apibased`.
         * Update the values for `apiSpecificationFile`to the path of your OpenAPI specification file. 
         * Update the `commands.id` value to the `operationId` in the OpenAPI specification document.

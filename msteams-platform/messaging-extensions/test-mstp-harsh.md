# Content Planning

## Who is your audience?

This could be broad—developers, for example—but defining your audience more specifically will help you refine your plan. Is your audience writing software? Apps? IT tools? Games? Are they hobbyists, full-time developers, or IT pros who write code? What development software do they use?

## What do they want to accomplish?

 Are they deciding whether to buy your product? Setting up a new computer? Learning new software? Preparing for a migration? Struggling with a PivotTable? Planning for network security? Is their need urgent? Few customers come to us to see what’s new. Understanding why they come will help you satisfy their needs.

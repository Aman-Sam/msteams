# Build API-based message extension

> [!NOTE]
>
> * API-based message extensions only support search commands.
> * API-based message extensions are available only in [public developer preview](../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

API-based message extensions are a type of Teams app that integrates your chat functionality directly into Teams, enhancing your app's usability and offering a seamless user experience.

Before you get started, ensure that you meet the following requirements:
</br>
<details><summary>1. OpenAPI Description (OAD)</summary>

Developers must not require users to enter a parameter for a header or cookie. If you need to pass headers, a default value for the header can be set in the specification. This simplifies the user experience and reduces the risk of errors.

* The `auth` property must not be specified.
* JSON and YAML are the supported formats.
* OpenAPI versions 2.0 and 3.0.x are supported.
* Teams doesn't support the `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`, and `not` (swagger.io) constructs.
* Constructing arrays for the request isn't supported, however, nested objects within a JSON request body are supported.
* The request body, if present, must be application/Json to ensure compatibility with a wide range of APIs.
* Define an HTTPS protocol server URL for the `servers.url` property.
* Only single parameter search is supported.
* Only one required parameter without a default value is allowed.
* Only POST and GET HTTP methods are supported.
* OpenAPI Description document must have an `operationId`.
* The operation must not have required Header or Cookie parameters without default values.
* A command must have exactly one parameter.
* Ensure that there are no remote references in the OpenAPI Description document.
* A required parameter with a default value is considered optional.

</details>

</br>

<details><summary>2. App manifest</summary>

* Set `composeExtension.Type` to `apiBased`.
* Define `composeExtension.apiSpecificationFile` as the relative path to the OpenAPI Description file within the folder.
* Define `apiResponseRenderingTemplateFile`  as the relative path to the response rendering template.
* Each command must have a link to the response rendering template.
* Full description must not exceed 128 characters.
* A command must have exactly one parameter.

</details>

</br>

<details><summary>3. Response rendering template</summary>

* Define the schema reference URL in the `$schema` property.
* Define `jsonPath` as the path to the relevant data/array in API response. if the path points to an array, then each entry in the array will be a separate result and if the path points to an object, there will only be a single result. *[Optional]*
* The supported values for `responseLayout` are `list` and `grid`.

The `JsonPath` property in response rendering template is $ to indicate the root object of the response data is used to render the Adaptive Card, and you can update the `jsonPath` property to point another property in response data.

If the root object of the OpenAPI schema contains well-known array property name, then Teams Toolkit uses the array property as root element to generate an Adaptive Card, and the array property name is used as `JsonPath` property for response rendering template. For example, if the property name contains `result`, `data`, `items`, `root`, `matches`, `queries`, `list`, `output` and the type is `array`, then it's used as root element.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>4. API message extension</summary>

API-based message extensions are a potent tool that enhances your Teams app's functionality by integrating with external APIs. This enhances the capabilities of your app and provides a richer user experience. To implement message extension from an API, you need to follow these guidelines:

* The `Commands.id` property in app manifest must match the corresponding `operationId` in the OpenAPI Description.
* If a required parameter is without a default value, the command `parameter.name` in the app manifest must match the `parameter.name` in the OpenAPI Description.
* If there's no required parameter, the command `parameter.name` in the app manifest must match the optional `parameter.name` in the OpenAPI Description.
* A command can't have more than one parameter.
* A response rendering template must be defined per command, which is used to convert responses from an API. The command section of the manifest must point to this template file under `composeExtension.command.apiResponseRenderingTemplateFile` within the app manifest. Each command points to a different response rendering template file.

</details>

You can create an API-based message extension using Visual Studio Code and Teams Toolkit CLI.

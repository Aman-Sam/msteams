# API-based Message extension

> [!NOTE]
>
> * API-based message extensions is available in [public preview](../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).
> * API-based message extension only supports search commands.

API-based message extensions use a web service to handle user requests and responses. They don't require a bot registration or a bot framework SDK. They can be configured and deployed using the Developer Portal for Teams or the Teams Toolkit.

You can create an API-based message extension in Teams using an [OpenAPI Specification](https://learn.openapis.org/specification/) document. After you've created an OpenAPI Specification document for the APIs you want to use, upload the OpenAPI Specification document to Teams Toolkit or Developer portal for Teams to generate and integrate the client code in your app's project. Create or generate an Adaptive Card template to handle the responses from the API.

API-based message extensions help your apps to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhancing its capabilities. With APIs for message extension, you can:

* Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
* Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my teamâ€™s design files in Figma.
* Perform actions on behalf of the user, for example, create a Jira ticket.

## Prerequisites

1. **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**: An OpenAPI Specification is used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases. You must have an OpenAPI specification document before you create an API-based message extension.

   The following code is an example of an OpenAPI specification document in YAML format: <br/>

   <details><summary>OpenAPI specification</summary>

   ```yml

   ```

   1. If you've created an OpenAPI specification document, you need an Adaptive Card template for the app to respond to the get requests. If your building an App using Teams Toolkit or Developer portal for teams, the tools will extract the information from the OpenAPI specification document automatically.

      The following is an example of the Adaptive Card template: <br/>

    <details><summary>Adaptive Card template</summary>

    ```json
    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "responseLayout": "grid",
        "responseCardTemplate": {
            "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
            "type": "AdaptiveCard",
            "version": "1.4",
            "body": [
                {

                        {
                            "type": "ColumnSet",
                            "columns": [
                                {

                                        }
                                    ]
                                },
                                {

                                            "size": "Medium"
                                        }

                                },
                                {

            "image": {
                "url": "${if(image, image, '')}"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    </details>

1. Update app manifest: Update the app manifest with the composeExtensions property. The following is an example of the app manifest with the `composeExtensions` property:

   ```json
      "composeExtensions": [
        {
          "type": "ApiBased",
          "apiSpecFile": "listrepairsapispec.yaml",
          "commands": [
            {
              "context": [
                "compose"
              ],
              "type": "query",
              "id": "listRepairs",
              "title": "List repairs",
              "parameters": [
                {
                  "title": "Filter",
                  "name": "filter",
                  "description": "Filter repairs by who they're assigned to."
                }
              ],
              "apiResponseRenderingTemplateFile": "listrepairsresponsetemplate.json"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "validDomains": [
        "repairs-api-2023.azurewebsites.net"
      ]
    }

   ```

   Ensure that the app manifest has the following information:

    * App name
    * App color icon
    * App outline icon
    * Terms of Service URL
    * Privacy policy URL
    * The authentication type in `composeExtension.auth`: no auth, aad, oauth, or service_http.

   **Query Parameters**

   |Name  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |`composeExtension.type`     |  Update the value as `ApiBased`. |
   |`composeExtension.apiSpecificationFile`     |  This references an OpenAPI spec file in the app package. Include when type is `ApiBased`.      |
   |`composeExtension.command.ID`      | The ID must  match the `OperationID` available in the  OpenAPI spec.       |
   |`composeExtension.command.context`      | An existing array where the entry points for ME is defined. The supported values are **compose**: Message Extension to show up as compose extension, **commandBox**: Message Extension to show up in Powerbar, and **message**: Message action |
   |`composeExtension.command.parameters`    | Include Title, Name, Description. The name must map to the parameter name in the OpenAPI spec.     |
   |`composeExtension.command.apiResponseRenderingTemplateFile`| A template used to format the JSON response from developerâ€™s API to Adaptive card response. *Mandatory* |

## Best practices

Message extension are a type of Teams app that allows you to integrate your chat functionality directly into Teams. This can enhance your app's usability and provide a seamless user experience. We recommend you to follow the best practices:

<details><summary>API-based message extensions</summary>

API-based message extensions are a powerful tool that allows you to extend the functionality of your Teams app by integrating with external APIs. This can greatly enhance the capabilities of your app and provide a richer user experience. To implement API-based message extension, you need to follow these guidelines:

* `Commands.id` in app manifest must match the corresponding `operationId` in the OpenAPI specification.
* If there's a required parameter without a default value, the parameter name of the command defined in the Teams app manifest must match this parameter name.
* If there's no required parameter without a default value, the parameter name in the Teams app manifest must match the name of an optional parameter defined for that operation.
* A command can't have more than one parameter.
* A response rendering template must be defined per command. This file, used to convert responses from an API, must be local just like the OpenAPI specification. The command portion of the manifest must point to this template file under`composeExtension.command.apiResponseRenderingTemplateFile` within the app manifest. Each command will point to a different response rendering template file.
* Add a `jsonPath` in the Adaptive Card template. The JSON path to the relevant data/array.

</details>

</br>

<details><summary>OpenAPI specification</summary>

Developers can't require users to enter a parameter for a header or cookie. If headers need to be passed, a default value for the header can be set in the specification. This simplifies the user experience and reduces the risk of errors.

* The `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`, `not` (swagger.io) construct aren't supported in Teams.
* Constructing arrays for the request aren't supported, but nested objects within a JSON request body are supported.
* The request body (if present) can only be application or json to ensure compatibility with a wide range of APIs.
* Only single parameter search is supported.
* Only one required parameter without a default value is allowed.
* The operation must have an `operationId`.
* Only  POST and GET HTTP methods are supported.

</details>

</br>

<details><summary>App manifest</summary>

* Set composeExtension.composeExtensionType to `apiBased`.
* Define `composeExtension.apiSpecificationFile` as the relative path to the OpenAPI specification file within the folder.
*

## Build API-based message extension

You can create an API-based message extension using Developer Portal for Teams, Teams Toolkit and Teams CLI.

# [Developer portal for Teams](#tab/developer-portal-for-teams)

1. Go to **Teams developer portal**.
1. Go to **Apps**.
1. Select **Create a new app**.
1. Under **Configure**, select **App features**.
1. Select **Messaging extension**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-me-tdp-app-feature.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the plugin of copilot option in Teams developer portal.":::

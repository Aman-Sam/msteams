# Authenticate messaging extensions

You can add authentication to your messaging extension by:
* Identifying the user, where `id` and `aadObjectId` are used as keys to look up the credentials or any cached state in your service.
* Authenticating the user by issuing a query, sending an `auth` response, signing in, and sending an **authentication code**.

Single sign-on support is available for messaging extensions and link unfurling. Enabling Single sign-on (SSO) for messaging extensions refreshes the authentication token. It minimizes the number of times you need to enter your sign in credentials for Microsoft Teams.

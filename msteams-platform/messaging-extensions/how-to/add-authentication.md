# Add authentication to your messaging extension

[!include[v4-to-v3-SDK-pointer](~/includes/v4-to-v3-pointer-me.md)]

## Identify the user

Every request to your services includes the user  ID, the user's display name and Azure Active Directory object ID.

```json
"from": {
  "id": "29:1C7dbRrC_5yzN1RGtZIrcWT0xz88KPGP9sxdpVpV8sODlgPHeQE9RqQ02hnpuKzy6zZ-AaZx6swUOMj_Dsdse3TQ4sIaeebbFBF-VgjJy_nY",
  "name": "Larry Jin",
  "aadObjectId": "cd723fa0-0591-416a-9290-e93ecf3a9b92"
},
```

The `id` and `aadObjectId` values are guaranteed for the authenticated Teams user and are used as keys to look up the credentials or any cached state in your service. Also, each request contains the Azure Active Directory tenant ID of the user, which is used to identify the user’s organization. If applicable, the request also contains the team ID and channel ID from which the request is originated.

## Authenticate the user

The users must sign in before they use the messaging extension, for services that require authentication. The authentication steps are as follows:

1. The user issues a query, or the default query is automatically sent to your service. Your service inspects the Teams user ID and checks for user authentication.
If the user isn't authenticated:
1. Send an `auth` response with an `openUrl` suggested action including the authentication URL. The Microsoft Teams client launches a dialog box hosting your webpage using the authentication URL.
1. The user must sign in.
1. You can close the window and send an **authentication code** to the Teams client.

The Teams client, includes the passed authentication code and reissues the query to your service.

Your service verifies the authentication code to ensure a malicious user doesn't compromise the sign in flow and it effectively 'closes the loop' to finish the secure authentication sequence.

### Respond with a sign in action

To prompt an unauthenticated user to, sign in, respond with a suggested action of type `openUrl` that includes the authentication URL. The example is as follows:

#### Response example for a sign in action

```json
{
  "composeExtension":{
    "type":"auth",
    "suggestedActions":{
      "actions":[
        {
          "type": "openUrl",
          "value": "https://example.com/auth",
          "title": "Sign in to this app"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> For the sign in experience to be hosted in a Teams pop-up window, the domain portion of the URL must be in your app’s list of valid domains. For more information, see [validDomains](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#validdomains).

### Start the sign in flow

Your sign in experience must be responsive and fit within a pop-up window. It should integrate with the [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client), which uses message passing.

Alike embedded experiences inside Microsoft Teams, your code inside the window needs to call `microsoftTeams.initialize()`. If your code does an OAuth flow, you can pass the Teams user ID into your window that passes it to the OAuth sign in URL.

### Complete the sign in flow

When the sign in request completes and redirects back to your page, it must do the following steps:

1. Generate a security code. It's a random number. Cache this code on your service with the credentials obtained through the sign in flow, such as OAuth 2.0 tokens.
1. Call `microsoftTeams.authentication.notifySuccess` and pass the security code.

At this point, the window closes and the control is passed to Teams client. The client reissues the original user query, along with the security code in the `state` property. Your code can use the security code to look up the credentials and complete the user request.

## Bot Framework Samples

The Teams Search Auth Config for [**JavaScript/Node.js**](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/javascript_nodejs/52.teams-messaging-extensions-search-auth-config) and [**C-Sharp/DotNetCore**](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/52.teams-messaging-extensions-search-auth-config) sample projects, found on GitHub, demonstrate how to create messaging extensions that include a configuration page and Bot Service authentication. The samples also demonstrate how to create message extensions that accept search requests and return the results after the user has signed in.

# Build message extensions

Message extensions allow the users to interact with your web service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client. They can search or initiate actions in an external system from the compose message area, the command box, or directly from a message. You can send back the results of that interaction to the Teams client in the form of a richly formatted card.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Message extensions are available in [Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC-High, and Department of Defense (DOD)](~/concepts/app-fundamentals-overview.md#government-community-cloud) environments.

This document gives an overview of the message extension, tasks performed under different scenarios, working of message extension, action and search commands, and link unfurling.

The following image displays the locations from where message extensions are invoked:

> [!NOTE]
> @mentioning message extensions is no longer supported in the compose box.

## Scenarios where message extensions are used

| Scenario | Example |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|
|You want some external system to do an action  and the result of the action to be sent back to your conversation.|Reserve a resource and allow the channel to know the reserved time slot.|
|You want to find something in an external system, and share the results with the conversation.|Search for a work item in Azure DevOps, and share it with the group as an Adaptive Card.|
|You want to complete a complex task involving multiple steps or lots of information in an external system, and share the results with a conversation.|Create a bug in your tracking system based on a Teams message, assign that bug to Bob, and send a card to the conversation thread with the bug's details.|

## Understand how message extensions work

A message extension consists of a web service that you host and an app manifest, which defines where your web service is invoked from in the Teams client. The web service takes advantage of the Bot Framework's messaging schema and secure communication protocol, so you must register your web service as a bot in the Bot Framework.

> [!NOTE]
> Though you can create the web service manually, use [Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk) to work with the protocol.

In the app manifest for Teams app, a single message extension is defined with up to 10 different commands. Each command defines a type, such as action or search and the locations in the client from where it's invoked. The invoke locations are compose message area, command bar, and message. On invoke, the web service receives an HTTPS message with a JSON payload including all the relevant information. Respond with a JSON payload, allowing the Teams client to know the next interaction to enable.

## Types of message extension commands

There are two types of message extension commands, action command and search command. The message extension command type defines the UI elements and interaction flows available to your web service. Some interactions, such as authentication and configuration are available for both types of commands.

### Action commands

Action commands are used to present the users with a modal pop-up to collect or display information. When the user submits the form, your web service responds by inserting a message into the conversation directly or by inserting a message into the compose message area. After that, the user can submit the message. You can chain multiple forms together for more complex workflows.

The action commands are triggered from the compose message area, the command box, or from a message. When the command is invoked from a message, the initial JSON payload sent to your bot includes the entire message it was invoked from. The following image displays the message extension action command task module:

:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/task-module.png" alt-text="Message extension action command task module":::

### Search commands

Search commands allow the users to search an external system for information either manually through a search box, or by pasting a link to a monitored domain into the compose message area and insert the results of the search into a message. In the most basic search command flow, the initial invoke message includes the search string that the user submitted. You respond with a list of cards and card previews. The Teams client renders a list of card previews for the user. When the user selects a card from the list, the full-size card is inserted into the compose message area.

The cards are triggered from the compose message area or the command box and not triggered from a message. They can't be triggered from a message.
The following image displays the message extension search command task module:

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on cards, see [what are cards](../task-modules-and-cards/what-are-cards.md).

## API message extension

An API based message extension helps to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhancing its capabilities and broadening its range of capabilities. WIth APIs for message extension, you can:

* Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
* Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my team’s design files in Figma.
* Perform actions on behalf of the user, for example, create a Jira ticket.

If you don't already have a message extension, there are two ways to build one:

* API-based ME: Using the Teams Toolkit, developers can easily create a API-backed ME from an existing API or ChatGPT plugin. This method requires an OpenAPI specification, documenting the API. For more information, see [Build copilot plugin](../copilot/build-api-based-message-extension.md).

* Bot-based ME: For developers that want a one-on-one conversational experience in addition to their plugin, they can create a new message extension from a bot using the Teams Toolkit. For more information, see [Build Bot based Message extension](../copilot/build-bot-based-message-extension.md).

The following table differentiates the types of Message extensions plugins:

|API based message extension  |Bot based message extension  |
|---------|---------|
|- Simpler and faster to create and maintain <br> - Use this option if you’re not planning to add a conversational bot to your app - <br> Do not require any additional code or resources for bot logic <br> - Suitable for scenarios where the plugin only needs to communicate with a web service and does not need any complex logic or state management <br> - Privatized traffic as they don’t rely on Azure bot infrastructure.| - More flexibility <br> - Use this option if you’re also planning to build a conversational bot <br> - Can leverage the full capabilities of the bot framework SDK <br> - Suitable for scenarios where the plugin needs to communicate with multiple services, handle complex logic or user interactions, or maintain state across sessions.|

## Link unfurling

A web service is invoked when a URL is pasted in the compose message area. This functionality is known as link unfurling. You can subscribe to receive an invoke when URLs containing a particular domain are pasted into the compose message area. Your web service can "unfurl" the URL into a detailed card, providing more information than the standard website preview card. You can add buttons to allow the users to immediately take action without leaving the Teams client.
The following images display link unfurling feature when a link is pasted in message extension:

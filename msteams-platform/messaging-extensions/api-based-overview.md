# API-based Message extension

> [!NOTE]
>
> * API-based message extensions is available in [public preview](../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).
> * API-based message extension only supports search commands.

API-based message extensions use a web service to handle user requests and responses and don't require a bot registration or a bot framework SDK. They can be configured and deployed using the Developer Portal for Teams or the Teams Toolkit.

You can create an API-based message extension in Teams using an [OpenAPI Specification](https://learn.openapis.org/specification/) document. After you've created an OpenAPI Specification document for the APIs you want to use, upload the OpenAPI Specification document to Teams Toolkit or Developer portal for Teams to generate and integrate the client code in your app's project. Create or generate an Adaptive Card template to handle the responses from the API.

API-based message extensions help your apps to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhancing its capabilities. With APIs for message extension, you can:

* Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
* Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my teamâ€™s design files in Figma.
* Perform actions on behalf of the user, for example, create a Jira ticket.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you adhere to the following requirements:

* [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](#openapi-specification)

* [Update app manifest](#update-app-manifest)

### OpenAPI Specification

OpenAPI specification (OAS) is the industry-standard specification that outlines how OpenAPI files are structured and outlined. It's a language-agnostic, human-readable format for describing APIs. It's easy for both humans and machines to read and write. The schema is machine-readable and represented in either YAML or JSON. You must have an OpenAPI specification document before you create an API-based message extension.

The following code is an example of an OpenAPI specification document in YAML format: <br/>

### Response rendering template

A response rendering template is used to map the JSON responses to a preview card and Adaptive Card. The preview cards are shown for the results and when a user selects a search result. The preview is expanded to show an Adaptive Card in the compose box.

A response rendering template must be present for each search command and each command must correspond to an operation in the OpenAPI spec but not every operation defined in an API spec has to be a command. The response rendering template consists of an Adaptive Card template, Preview card template, and metadata.

**Preview Card**

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-message-extension-preview-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of how the compose extension looks like, displaying an array of preview cards when searching for a specific word. In this case, searching for 'a' in the  'SME test app' returns five cards showing 'Title', 'Description' (truncated) and 'AssignedTo' properties and values in each one.":::

**Expanded Adaptive Card**

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-message-extension-expanded-adative-card.png" alt-text="Example of how the adaptive card looks like expanded once a user selects a preview card. The adaptive card shows the 'Title', the full 'Description', 'AssignedTo', 'RepairId' and 'Date' values.":::

#### Details and Schema changes

|Property  |Type  |Description  |Required  |
|--------- |---------|---------|---------|
|`version` |  `string` | The schema version of the current response rendering template.        |  Yes       |
|`jsonPath`     | `string`        | The path  to the relevant section in the results to which the responseCardTemplate and previewCardTemplate should be applied. If not set, the root object is treated as the relevant section. If the relevant section is an array, each entry is mapped to the responseCardTemplate and the previewCardTemplate.        |   No      |
|`responseLayout`    | `responseLayoutType`        |  Specifies the layout of the results in the message extension flyout. The Supported types are `list` and `grid`.       |    Yes     |
|`responseCardTemplate`    |  `adaptiveCardTemplate`  | A template for creating an adaptive card from a result entry.      |   Yes      |
|`previewCardTemplate`     |  `previewCardTemplate`       | A template for creating a preview card from a result entry. The resulting preview card is shown in the message extension flyout.        |  Yes       |

#### Schema mapping

The properties in OpenAPI specification document are mapped to the Adaptive Card template as follows:

* `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean` types are converted to a TextBlock.

# API-based Message extension

> [!NOTE]
>
> * API-based message extensions are only available in [public preview](../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md) .
> * API-based message extensions only support search commands.

API-based message extensions use a web service to manage user requests and responses and don't require a bot registration or a Bot Framework. You can configure and deploy API-based message extensions using Teams Toolkit. API-based message extensions help your apps to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhancing its capabilities. With APIs for message extension, you can:

* Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
* Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my teamâ€™s design files in Figma.
* Perform actions on behalf of the user, for example, create a Jira ticket.

You can create an API-based message extension using an [OpenAPI Specification](https://learn.openapis.org/specification/) document. After you've created an OpenAPI Specification document, upload the OpenAPI Specification document to Teams Toolkit to generate and integrate the client code in your app's project. Create or generate a response rendering to manage the responses from the API.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you adhere to the following requirements:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](#openapi-specification)
> * [Update app manifest](#update-app-manifest)

### OpenAPI Specification

OpenAPI specification (OAS) is the industry-standard specification that outlines how OpenAPI files are structured and outlined. It's a language-agnostic, human-readable format for describing APIs. It's easy for both humans and machines to read and write. The schema is machine-readable and represented in either YAML or JSON. You must have an OpenAPI specification document before you create an API-based message extension.

The following code is an example of an OpenAPI specification document: <br/>

### Response rendering template

A response rendering template is used to map the JSON responses to a preview card and Adaptive Card. The preview cards are displayed as results when a user selects a search result. The preview card expands as an Adaptive Card in the message compose box.

A response rendering template must be present for each search command and each command must correspond to an operation in the OpenAPI specification but not every operation defined in an OpenAPI specification must be a command. The response rendering template consists of an Adaptive Card template, Preview card template, and metadata.

**Preview Card**

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-message-extension-preview-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of how the compose extension looks like, displaying an array of preview cards when searching for a specific word. In this case, searching for 'a' in the  'SME test app' returns five cards showing 'Title', 'Description' (truncated) and 'AssignedTo' properties and values in each one.":::

**Expanded Adaptive Card**

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-message-extension-expanded-adaptive-card.png" alt-text="Example of how the adaptive card looks like expanded once a user selects a preview card. The adaptive card shows the 'Title', the full 'Description', 'AssignedTo', 'RepairId' and 'Date' values.":::

|`jsonPath`     | `string`        | The path  to the relevant section in the results to which the responseCardTemplate and previewCardTemplate should be applied.

|`responseLayout`    | `responseLayoutType`        |  Specifies the layout of the results in the message extension flyout. The Supported types are `list` and `grid`.       |    Yes     |
|`responseCardTemplate`    |  `adaptiveCardTemplate`  | A template for creating an adaptive card from a result entry.      |   Yes      |
|`previewCardTemplate`     |  `previewCardTemplate`       | A template for creating a preview card from a result entry. The resulting preview card is displayed in the message extension flyout menu.        |  Yes       |

#### Schema mapping

The properties in OpenAPI specification document are mapped to the Adaptive Card template as follows:

* `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean` types are converted to a TextBlock.

                      name:
                        type: string
    ```

  * **Target Schema**: `Container`

    ```json
        {
                  "type": "Container",
                  "$data": "${$root}",
                  "items": [
                    {
                      "type": "TextBlock",
                      "text": "id: ${if(id, id, 'N/A')}",

                      "wrap": true
                    }
                  ]
                }
                
    ```

</details>

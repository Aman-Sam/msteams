# Create low-code custom apps for Microsoft Teams

[Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/platform) is both extensible and adaptive. This means that you have the freedom to build custom applications for Teams that meet the distinct needs of your users. Although you can create apps from scratch, with today's demand for speedy solutions, a low-code option may be just what you need to build elegant apps within a compressed time frame.

Low code platforms provide an intuitive approach to software development and require little or no coding to build applications and processes. Citizen developers are enabled to easily build custom apps and professional developers can accelerate the app development and deployment process exponentially. Most low-code platforms consist of a visual interface, connectors to back-end services, and a built in app lifecycle management system to build, debug, deploy and maintain applications. Microsoft provides several innovative gateways to rapidly build great Teams-compatible apps using low-code attributes:

1. [Microsoft Power Platform](#teams-and-microsoft-power-platform)
1. [Microsoft Teams app templates](#teams-app-templates)

## Teams and Microsoft Power Platform

Microsoft Power Platform(/power-platform) combines four robust Microsoft technologies in one powerful application platform. Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) and Power Virtual Agents empower you to build solutions, automate processes, analyze data,  and create virtual agents within a unified and integrated environment:

### ✔ Teams and Power BI

The [Power BI tab for Microsoft Teams](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-new-power-bi-tab-for-microsoft-teams/) adds support for reports in the Teams workspace and allows users to [share interactive Power BI content](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-embed-report-microsoft-teams) and [collaborating with others inTeams](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-collaborate-microsoft-teams) channels and chats. You can create packaged [Power BI app](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-distribute-apps) content from scratch and distribute as an app or you can [Create a template app in Power BI](/connect-data/service-template-apps-create). Additionally, use the new [Power BI app in Teams](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2143643) to bring your entire basic Power BI service experience into Teams.

### ✔ Teams and Power Apps

With [Power Apps](/powerapps/powerapps-overview), you can build business apps that connect to your business data and are tailored to your organization's  needs.  Power Apps enables a wide range of app scenarios to solve business challenges via [canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/#canvas-apps). Once your app is built, it can be exported from the Power Apps maker portal and [embedded in Microsoft Teams](/power-platform/admin/embed-app-teams).

The new [Power Apps app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2143374) in Teams provides an integrated experience for app makers to create and edit apps and workflows within Teams and quickly publish and share them for anyone on the team to use without having to switch between multiple apps and services.

### ✔ Teams and Power Automate

With the [Power Automate app in Teams](/power-automate/flows-teams), you can [create flows to automate repetitive work tasks](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_teams/microsoft-teams/) directly within the Teams environment. You can [trigger a flow from any message in Microsoft Teams](/power-automate/trigger-flow-teams-message) and [use adaptive cards within Power Automate](/power-automate/create-adaptive-cards). Additionally, you can build flows to customize and add further value to Microsoft Teams from within the new [Power Apps app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2143539) in Teams.

### ✔ Teams and Power Virtual Agents

[Power Virtual Agents](/power-virtual-agents/fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents) is a no-code, guided graphical interface solution, built on the Microsoft Power Platform and the Bot Framework, that empowers every member of your team to create and maintain rich, conversational chatbots that easily integrate with the Teams platform. All content authored in Power Virtual Agents renders naturally in Teams and Power Virtual Agents bots engage with users in the Teams native chat canvas. You can [integrate your Power Virtual Agents chatbot](/power-virtual-agents/publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams) to Teams via the [Power Virtual Agents portal](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com)

With the new [Power Virtual Agents app](https://aka.ms/pva-teams-docs) in Teams, you can create, manage, and publish conversational chatbots easily from within Teams and share your bots with other people in your organization so they can chat and have their questions answered.

### ✔ App template catalog

[App templates](../samples/app-templates.md) are production-ready apps for Microsoft Teams that are community driven, open-source, and available on GitHub. Each template contains detailed instructions for deploying and installing that app for your organization, providing a ready-to-use app that you can install and begin using immediately. The complete source code is available as well, so you can explore it in detail, or fork the code and alter it to meet your specific needs.

### ✔ Virtual Assistant for Teams

Virtual Assistant is a Microsoft open-source template that enables you to create a robust conversational solution while maintaining full control of user experience, organizational branding, and necessary data. You can configure your virtual assistant for [integration into the Teams environment](https://microsoft.github.io/botframework-solutions/clients-and-channels/tutorials/enable-teams/1-intro).

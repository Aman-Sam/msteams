# Create low-code custom apps for Microsoft Teams

The [Microsoft Teams platform](/microsoftteams/platform)  is extensible and adaptive. This means that you have the freedom to build custom applications for Teams to meet the distinct needs of your users. Although you can create apps from scratch, with today's demand for speedy solutions, a low-code option  may be just what you need to create elegant apps within compressed time frames. Low code platforms provide an intuitive approach to software development that require little or no coding to build applications and processes.  This enables citizen developers to easily build custom apps and professional developers to accelerate the app development and deployment process exponentially. Most low-code platforms consist of a visual interface, connectors to back-end services, and a built in app lifecycle management system to build, debug, deploy and maintain applications. Microsoft has many innovative possibilities to rapidly build great Teams-compatible apps using low-code attributes:

1. [Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform) integrations include [Virtual assistant for Teams](virtual-assistant.md) and [Power Virtual Agents for Teams](../bots/how-to/add-power-virtual-agents-bot-to-teams.md)
1. [Microsoft Teams app templates](app-templates.md) are production-ready apps available on GitHub.
1. MicrosoftTeams Toolkit extensions guide you through the entire process of building, debugging, and launching your Teams app directly within the [Visual Studio Code](../toolkit/visual-studio-code-overview.md) or [Visual Studio](../toolkit/visual-studio-overview.md) environments.

## Microsoft Power Platform and Teams

Power Platform combines four robust Microsoft technologies in one powerful application platform. Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) and Power Virtual Agents empower you to build solutions, automate processes, analyze data,  and create virtual agents within a unified and integrated environment:

### Power BI  and Teams

The [Power BI tab for Microsoft Teams](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-new-power-bi-tab-for-microsoft-teams/) adds support for reports in the Teams workspace and allows users to [share interactive Power BI content](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-embed-report-microsoft-teams) and [collaborating with others inTeams](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-collaborate-microsoft-teams) channels and chats. You can create packaged [Power BI app](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-distribute-apps) content from scratch and distribute as an app or you can [Create a template app in Power BI](/connect-data/service-template-apps-create) .

### Power Apps and Teams

With [Power Apps](/powerapps/powerapps-overview), you can build business apps that connect to your business data and are tailored to your organization's  needs.  Power Apps enables a wide range of app scenarios to solve business challenges via [canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/#canvas-apps) and [modal-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/#model-driven-apps). Once your app is built, it can be exported from the Power Apps maker portal and [embedded in Microsoft Teams](/power-platform/admin/embed-app-teams).

### Power Automate and Teams

With the [Power Automate app in Teams](/power-automate/flows-teams), you can [create flows to automate repetitive work tasks](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_teams/microsoft-teams/) directly within the Teams environment. Additionally, you can [trigger a flow from any message in Microsoft Teams](/power-automate/trigger-flow-teams-message) and [use adaptive cards within Power Automate](/power-automate/create-adaptive-cards).

### Power Virtual Agents and Teams

[Power Virtual Agents](/power-virtual-agents/fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents) is a no-code, guided graphical interface solution, built on the Microsoft Power Platform and the Bot Framework, that empowers every member of your team to create and maintain rich, conversational chatbots that easily integrate with the Teams platform. All content authored in Power Virtual Agents renders naturally in Teams and Power Virtual Agents bots engage with users in the Teams native chat canvas. You can [integrate your Power Virtual Agents chatbot](/power-virtual-agents/publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams) to Teams via the [Power Virtual Agents portal](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com)

## app templates catalog

 ![solutions](../assets/images/power-platform-and-teams/app-template-illustration.svg)

App templates are production-ready apps for Microsoft Teams that are community driven, open-source, and available on GitHub. Each contains detailed instructions for deploying and installing that app for your organization, providing a ready-to-use app that you can install and begin using immediately. The complete source code is available as well, so you can explore it in detail, or fork the code and alter it to meet your specific needs.

# Code samples for the Microsoft Teams developer platform

Here you will find a list of code samples that demonstrate various capabilities of the Microsoft Teams development platform and how to build apps to leverage those features.

## Getting samples

Microsoft hosts much of its sample code in GitHub, a web-based Git repository hosting service. If youâ€™re not familiar with Git or GitHub, we recommend that you review the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) and follow the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) project in GitHub Guides.

To download our samples from GitHub:

1. Open the project in GitHub
2. Choose the **Clone or download** button and copy the URL
3. Open a command prompt in the parent directory into which you want to install the sample project
4. Run `git clone <pasted url>`

This process copies the entire project to your computer. Most samples containing bots provide code in both Node.js and .NET/C#; you can find the code you want in the appropriate subdirectory.

### For .NET/C# samples

Each of our .NET samples includes a Visual Studio solution file that contains all required libraries.

### For Node.js samples

We provide a packages.json file that lists all required packages for a sample. Simply run `npm install` from the command line in your Node.js project directory to install the required packages. You're now ready to open the project in Visual Studio Code and start experimenting.

### For other samples

As always, the project's README file should have more information on specific needs for specific samples.

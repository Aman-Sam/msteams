# Deploy Collaboration controls to Microsoft Teams

Collaboration controls currently work best within Microsoft Teams. You can create a new app that can be embedded inside Teams app as both, a personal app and a tab app.

## Configure the app for Teams

The app that you have created in [create a model-driven application](/samples/app-with-collaboration-controls.md#create-a-model-driven-application) only have a single left pane and there are no complex commands. So before adding your app into Teams, you can hide the left pane and make more comprehensible header view.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't enable the following steps if you want to display the left pane and high-density header to your users.

To do so, we'll use Power Apps **new app** settings.

1. Go to **Solutions** in the left pane.

1. Go to the bottom of your solutions list and select **Default solution**.

1. Search for and select **Setting definition**.

1. Search and select **Hide the navbar** from the list of settings definitions. This hides the left pane in your application.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/hide-the-nav-bar.png" alt-text="Hide the nav bar" border="true":::

1. On the lower right  of your application in the edit pane, there is a section titled **Setting app values**. If you created your app using the modern app designer, your app appears on the list. Select **New app value** under your app.

1. Change the value from **No** to **Yes.**

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/value-to-yes.png" alt-text="Change value to yes" border="true":::

1. Select **Save.**

1. Search and select **App high density page header** from the list of settings definitions and repeat the process.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/density-page-header.png" alt-text="Density page header" border="true":::

1. Select **Back to solutions**.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/default-solution.png" alt-text="Default solution" border="true":::

1. Select **Publish all customizations** to publish all the work you've completed.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/publish-cusomization.png" alt-text="Publish all customizations" border="true":::

## Add the app to Microsoft Teams app catalog

As the settings are defined, you can now add the app to Microsoft Teams. To start with, browse to the **Apps** page in the Power Apps maker portal and find the app that you have created and select More options **â€¦**.

To add the app to Teams, select **Add to Teams**.

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/add-to-teams.png" alt-text="Add to Teams" border="true":::

Selecting **Add to Teams** opens a dialog where you can review the details and select **Download app**, which saves the Microsoft Teams app manifest to your device.

To upload your app to Teams, see [upload your app in Team](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload.md)

## Enable others to use your application

Following are required to enable users to run the deployed Collaboration Manager applications built using the Collaboration controls:

* Create a Collaboration team
* Add members to the team
* Create a security role
* Assign security roles to team members

     1. Select **Settings** > **Users** + **permissions**.
     1. Select **Teams**.

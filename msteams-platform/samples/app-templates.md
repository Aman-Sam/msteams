# App Templates for Microsoft Teams

App templates are production-ready apps for Microsoft Teams that are community driven, open-source, and available on GitHub. Each contains detailed instructions for deploying and installing that app for your organization, providing a ready-to-use app that you can install and begin using immediately. The complete source code is available as well, so you can explore it in detail, or fork the code and alter it to meet your specific needs.

## Key benefits of using app templates

* **Plug and play experience:** All app templates include deployments scripts that will allow you to host all necessary services in Microsoft Azure. No coding is required to deploy the apps.
* **Production-ready code:** The app templates conform to recommended best practices around security and infrastructure, and all community submitted changes to them are reviewed to ensure continued conformance.
* **Customizable and extensible:** While all app templates are ready to deploy as they are, we provide the entire code base and deployment scripts so that you can easily customize or extend them to fit your unique needs.
* **Detailed documentation & support:** All app templates are accompanied by end-to-end documentation on solution architecture, deployment, and configuration steps. The repositories are monitored as well, so please report any issues you encounter by raising an Issue on GitHub.

## Available app templates

### Customer Stickers

Self-expression is core to a healthy team culture. This app template is a [messaging extension](~/concepts/messaging-extensions/search-extensions.md) that enables your users to use custom stickers and GIFs within Microsoft Teams. This template provides an easy web-based configuration experience where anyone with configuration access can upload the GIFs/stickers/images they want their end-users to have, allowing your entire team to use any set of stickers you chose.

This app also enables easy sharing of images/GIFs/stickers across teams without needing access to SharePoint sites or individual channels as storage and sharing mechanisms. For example, product teams can easily share product images and GIFs to social media, marketing and sales teams programmatically. One can also extend this app by triggering a notification flow to specific teams/individuals when new images/GIFs are made available.

### Icebreaker

Icebreaker is a [Microsoft Teams bot](~/concepts/bots/bots-overview.md) that helps your team get closer by pairing two random team members up every week to meet. The bot makes scheduling easy by automatically suggesting free times that work for both members. Strengthen personal connections and build a tightly knit community with this app.

In addition to encouraging personal connections across your entire team, the Icebreaker app can help cultivate interest-based communities within your organization. For example, you can use this app for a DevOps interest group to help ideas and best practices organically spread across your organization.

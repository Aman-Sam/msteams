# App Templates for Microsoft Teams

App templates are production-ready apps for Microsoft Teams that are community driven, open-source, and available on GitHub. Each has contains detailed instructions for deploying and installing that app for your organization, providing a ready-to-use app that you can install and begin using immediately. The complete source code is available as well, so you can explore it in detail, or fork the code and alter it to meet your specific needs.

## Key benefits of using app templates

* **Plug and play experience:** All app templates include deployments scripts that will allow you to host all necessary services in Microsoft Azure. No coding is required to deploy the apps.
* **Production-ready code:** The app templates conform to recommended best practices around security and infrastructure, and all community submitted changes to them are reviewed to ensure continued conformance.
* **Customizable and extensible:** While all app templates are ready to deploy as they are, we provide the entire code base and deployment scripts so that you can easily customize or extend them to fit your unique needs.
* **Detailed documentation & support:** All app templates are accompanied by end-to-end documentation on solution architecture, deployment, and configuration steps. The repositories are monitored as well, so please report any issues you encounter by raising an Issue on GitHub.

## Available app templates

### SharePoint List Search

The List Search app template allows you to search your SharePoint lists and insert information about that item directly into a chat. This app makes use of [task modules](~/concepts/task-modules/task-modules-overview.md) triggered from a [action-based messaging extension](~/concepts/messaging-extensions/create-extensions.md) to allow your users to search across multiple SharePoint lists and then insert the results into a chat as an [adaptive card](~/concepts/cards/cards-reference.md#adaptive-card), along with a link to the item in SharePoint.

When you are configuring the app you can specify which SharePoint lists your users will be able to search, as well as what columns they will search across. You can also specify more than one administrator that can alter these settings as your needs evolve.

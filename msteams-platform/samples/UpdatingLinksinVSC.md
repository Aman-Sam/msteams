# Update links in Visual Studio Code

You can update links in a document using Visual Studio Code. This may mean changing the link text or the link URL.

To update a link:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Open the .md in which you want to update the link.
1. Locate the existing link. It should look like this:
`[Example Link](https://www.examplelink.com/oldlink)`
1. Update the link as follows:
	- If you want to change the link text, update the text within the square brackets.
	- If you want to change the link URL, update it in the parenthesis.

1. Save the changes.

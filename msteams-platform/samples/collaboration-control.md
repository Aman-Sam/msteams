# Collaboration controls overview

 The solutions that make up Collaboration Controls allow makers to build applications that integrate with Microsoft 365 services like Planner, Bookings, and Outlook.

 Key capabilities of Collaboration Controls include the following:

 **Microsoft Planner tasks:** Create tasks that are assigned to members of a record so that they can view a consolidated list of remaining items within the Tasks app within Microsoft Teams.

 **Dataverse Tasks:** Create tasks that can be assigned to users who are external to your organization.

 **Dataverse Notes:** Create notes that are assigned to a record in your app.

 **Outlook Meetings:** Schedule meetings with both customers and internal employees and seamlessly connect with others with Microsoft Teams with a select of a button.

 **Microsoft Teams channel conversations:** Participate in channel conversations with your
 colleagues to get questions quickly answered and to notify others of important events.

 **SharePoint Files:** Upload, view, pin/unpin, and share files with members of a record so that you can search, reference, and edit relevant artifacts in a centralized location backed by SharePoint.

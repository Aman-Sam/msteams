# Build low-code and no-code custom apps for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is both extensible and customizable meaning you can build custom applications for Teams to meet the distinct needs of your users. Low-code development platforms allow citizen developers to quickly build custom apps and professional developers to accelerate app development and deployment. Low-code is an intuitive software development approach that requires little to no coding in order to build applications and processes. Users with little or no coding knowledge or software development experience can create applications with minimal or no additional code required. Most platforms consist of a visual interface, connectors to back-end services, and a built in app lifecycle manager to build, debug, deploy and maintain applications. Microsoft has several innovative possibilities for quickly building great Teams-compatible apps with low-code attributes:

1. [Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform) integrations including [Virtual assistant for Teams](virtual-assistant.md) and [Power Virtual Agents for Teams ](add-power-virtual-agents-bot-to-teams.md)
1. [Teams app templates](app-templates.md)
1. Teams Toolkit for [Visual Studio Toolkit Code](visual-studio-code-overview.md) and [Visual Studio](visual-studio-overview.md)

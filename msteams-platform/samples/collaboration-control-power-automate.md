# Power Automate

Power Automate can be used to automate workflows around your Collaboration Manager application. For example, automatically create tasks when a new record is created.

This is an advanced scenario that requires Makers to build flows using [published Power Automate connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-powerautomate-connectors) (like the [Planner connector](/connectors/planner/)) to create flows and call Collaboration Toolkit APIs to associate the action with a record.

To interact with the Collaboration Toolkit API in a Power Automate Flow, the recommended approach is to use the [Dataverse Connector](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/) and [Perform an Unbound Action](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/).

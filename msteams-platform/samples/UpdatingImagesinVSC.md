# Update images in Visual Studio Code
You can update an image using Visual Studio Code. You want to change the alt text for the image or the path to the new image, or both.

To update an image:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Open the .md in which you want to update the image.
1. Locate the code line for the image. It should look like this:
`![Example Image](/path/stored/oldimage)`
1. Update the image as follows:
	- If you want to change the alt text, update the text within the square brackets.
	- If you want to change the image path, update it in the parenthesis.
1. Save the changes.

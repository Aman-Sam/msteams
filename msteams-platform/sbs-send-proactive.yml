    A proactive message is any message sent by a bot that isn't in response to a request from a user that includes messages, such as:
     - Welcome messages
     - Notifications
     - Scheduled messages
     
    This step-by-step guide helps you to send a proactive message from a bot. You'll see the following outputs:

    * Proactive hello message in chat.
